Document parsing and knowledge extraction tools.

## Thesis

**Knowledge is trapped in documents.** PDFs, Word docs, slides, videos—billions of hours of human effort locked in formats machines can't reason about. These tools crack open that vault: parsing complex layouts, extracting structured data, chunking for retrieval, turning the world's unstructured knowledge into something AI can actually use. The bottleneck isn't intelligence; it's ingestion.
