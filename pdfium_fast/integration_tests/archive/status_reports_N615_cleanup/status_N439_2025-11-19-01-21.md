## Worker Identity
- **Worker**: WORKER0
- **Iteration**: N=439
- **Type**: Regular development cycle (no special cycle requirement)

## System Health

**Working Tree**: Clean (1 commit added - status report from N=438)

**System Resources**:
- Load average: 2.60 (healthy, well below 6.0 threshold)
- Disk usage: 41% (541Gi free)
- Binary: out/Release/pdfium_cli (116K, Nov 18 16:19)

## Test Results

- Duration: 46.78s
- Command: `pytest -m smoke -q`
- Timestamp: 2025-11-19T01:20:09Z

**Test Categories**:
- Infrastructure: 3/3 PASS
- Smoke: 43/43 PASS
- Edge Cases: 20/20 PASS

## Production Status

**Version**: v1.4.0 (operational)

**Capabilities**:
- Text extraction: 100% byte-for-byte correctness
- Image rendering: 100% pixel-perfect correctness
- Multi-process parallelism: 3.0x+ speedup (workers)
- Multi-thread parallelism: 6.55x speedup (K=8 threads)
- PNG optimization: 11x single-threaded speedup
- Combined speedup: 72x (11x PNG × 6.55x threading)
- Smart mode: Always-on (545x JPEG fast path for scanned PDFs)
- Adaptive threading: Opt-in via --adaptive flag

**Optimization Status**: Complete
- Stop Condition #2 met (N=343, N=392, N=405 profiling confirmation)
- Memory-bound system: NO function >2% CPU time
- All viable CPU optimizations exhausted
- Current focus: System maintenance and documentation accuracy

## Documentation Status

**Core Documentation**: Verified accurate
- README.md: v1.4.0 performance data, CLI examples correct
- CLAUDE.md: Updated with N=438 status, cycle protocol accurate
- OPTIMIZATION_ROADMAP.md: Complete status, all 15 optimizations documented
- RELEASE_NOTES_V1.4.0.md: Release details accurate

## Upcoming Cycles

**Next Cycles**:
- N=440: CLEANUP (440 mod 5 = 0) - Code and documentation refactoring
- N=442: BENCHMARK (442 mod 13 = 0) - Performance measurement on corpus

**Note**: With optimization complete (Stop Condition #2), CLEANUP cycles focus on maintenance and documentation, while BENCHMARK cycles verify system stability and test suite health.

## Summary

N=439 routine health check complete. System remains stable and production-ready. All 70 smoke tests pass. Working tree clean. System resources healthy. Documentation accurate. Ready for N=440 CLEANUP cycle.
