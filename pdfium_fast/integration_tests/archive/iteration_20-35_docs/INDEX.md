# Archived Documentation - Iterations 20-35

**Archive Date**: 2025-11-02
**Archived By**: WORKER0 Iteration #39
**Status**: Historical - Kept for reference

## Purpose

This archive contains documentation from iterations 20-35 during the initial implementation and validation phase of the PDFium optimization project. These documents were active during:
- Baseline generation (iterations 20-30)
- C++ CLI implementation (iterations 29-32)
- System validation (iterations 33-34)
- Cleanup and documentation (iterations 35-36)
