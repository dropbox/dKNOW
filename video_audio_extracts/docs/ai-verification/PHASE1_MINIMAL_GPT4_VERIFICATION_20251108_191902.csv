"jpg_face","face-detection","test_files_wikimedia/jpg/object-detection/01_0butterfly1_up-08316.jpg","CORRECT","1.0","There are no faces present in the image. The output correctly shows an empty list for face detection. "
"jpg_object","object-detection","test_files_wikimedia/jpg/object-detection/01_0butterfly1_up-08316.jpg","INCORRECT","0.2","The object detected is labeled as a 'potted plant', but the image shows a flower with a spider on it. The label 'potted plant' is inaccurate. "
"jpg_ocr","ocr","test_files_wikimedia/jpg/object-detection/01_0butterfly1_up-08316.jpg","CORRECT","1.0","The OCR task returned no detected text, which is accurate as the image only features a flower and a spider, with no visible text present. "
"png_face","face-detection","test_files_wikimedia/png/emotion-detection/02_123inkt_logo_transparent_bg_small.png","CORRECT","1.0","The image is a logo without any faces. The face-detection output showing an empty list is correct. "
"png_object","object-detection","test_files_wikimedia/png/emotion-detection/02_123inkt_logo_transparent_bg_small.png","CORRECT","1.0","The object-detection output is empty, which is correct for this image as it contains a logo without recognizable objects typically detected by an object detection model. "
"png_ocr","ocr","test_files_wikimedia/png/emotion-detection/02_123inkt_logo_transparent_bg_small.png","INCORRECT","0.95","The OCR output is incorrect as it does not include any detected text. The image clearly shows the text '123inkt.nl' on a yellow ink droplet shape. "
"webp_face","face-detection","test_files_wikimedia/webp/emotion-detection/01_webp_lossy.webp","CORRECT","1.0","The image contains a landscape with no faces visible. The face-detection output, which shows an empty array, is correct. "
"webp_object","object-detection","test_files_wikimedia/webp/emotion-detection/01_webp_lossy.webp","CORRECT","1.0","The output correctly indicates no objects detected. The image depicts a natural landscape without distinct objects for detection. "
"mp3_transcript","transcription","test_files_wikimedia/mp3/transcription/02_Carla_Scaletti_on_natural_sounds_and_physical_modeling_(1999).mp3","SUSPICIOUS","0.75","The transcription output is mostly coherent and plausible, with some exceptions. The structure of the text generally makes sense and provides a logical flow from one idea to another. However, there is a notable error around 'which makes Blaine why I don't like the sound of bees,' which is nonsensical as part of the speech. Additionally, there are some minor timing overlaps in words. The language and quality scores given are plausible, and there are no issues with profanity. Overall, the transcription seems to capture the intended message, but there are certain errors that affect clarity. "
"wav_transcript","transcription","test_files_wikimedia/wav/audio-enhancement-metadata/03_LL-Q150_(fra)-WikiLucas00-audio.wav","SUSPICIOUS","0.7","The transcription output has some unusual elements: the 'language_probability' seems very low for a straightforward 'en' transcription, suggesting low confidence in language identification. Additionally, '[_BEG_]' and '[_TT_50]' appear as metadata markers, which are not typical meaningful components of clean transcriptions. Despite this, the main segment 'Good job.' is a coherent and plausible transcription. "
