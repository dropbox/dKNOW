"jpg_face_detection_1","face-detection","test_files_wikimedia/jpg/face-detection/06_2023-06-20_Vills_Foscari_16.jpg","CORRECT","1.0","The image contains an artistic installation and some text. There are no visible human faces in the image, so the output of an empty list for face detection is correct. "
"jpg_face_detection_2","face-detection","test_files_wikimedia/jpg/face-detection/09_Alexey_Akindinov._Boy_and_Crystal._1997.jpg","CORRECT","0.95","The image is a complex, abstract painting with a lot of intricate patterns and colors. There are no clear, realistic human faces visible in the image that would be detected by a face-detection algorithm. "
"jpg_object_detection_3","object-detection","test_files_wikimedia/jpg/object-detection/01_"Amelia"_(Homage_to_Amelia_Earhart)_by_Mary_Curtis_Ratcliff.jpg","CORRECT","1.0","The image contains an abstract art piece with a circular object and hanging strips. There are no recognizable objects such as animals, people, or text present in the image. "
"jpg_object_detection_4","object-detection","test_files_wikimedia/jpg/object-detection/04_150229-ColourwithStorage-Scene1_output.jpg","SUSPICIOUS","0.85","The object detection output includes several objects such as bottles, chairs, and dining tables. The bottles and chairs are correctly identified, but the confidence levels are relatively low. The dining table detection seems to overlap with the chairs, which might indicate a misclassification or overlap issue. "
"jpg_ocr_5","ocr","test_files_wikimedia/jpg/ocr/01_"Amelia"_(Homage_to_Amelia_Earhart)_by_Mary_Curtis_Ratcliff.jpg","CORRECT","0.95","The OCR output contains bounding boxes with no detected text, which matches the image as there is no visible text present. "
"jpg_ocr_6","ocr","test_files_wikimedia/jpg/ocr/09_Israeli_postal_card_50s.jpg","INCORRECT","0.9","The OCR output does not match the text present in the image. The image contains Hebrew text and a stamp with '10 ISRAEL' and other details, none of which were detected in the OCR output. "

"jpg_pose_estimation_10","pose-estimation","test_files_wikimedia/jpg/pose-estimation/10_Australian_Shepherd_red_merle_portrait_Canon_EOS_700D_Pentacon_200mm_f4.jpg","CORRECT","1.0","The image contains a dog, and there are no human bodies present for pose estimation. The output of an empty list is correct as there are no keypoints to detect on human bodies. "

The face-detection output correctly returned an empty list as there are no faces present. "
"png_face_detection_12","face-detection","test_files_wikimedia/png/face-detection/05_A_setiset_with_duplicated_piece.png","CORRECT","1.0","The image contains abstract shapes and patterns with no discernible human faces. The face-detection output correctly returns an empty list as there are no faces present. "

The output of an empty list is appropriate as there are no recognizable objects present. "
"png_object_detection_14","object-detection","test_files_wikimedia/png/object-detection/05_A_setiset_with_duplicated_piece.png","CORRECT","1.0","The image contains a set of geometric shapes arranged in a pattern. There are no distinct objects like animals, vehicles, or recognizable items that typical object detection models would identify. The output of an empty list is appropriate as there are no objects to detect. "

The image primarily consists of abstract watercolor art with no discernible text. "
"png_ocr_16","ocr","test_files_wikimedia/png/ocr/05_A_setiset_with_duplicated_piece.png","INCORRECT","0.9","The OCR output does not match the image content. The image contains puzzle pieces with no visible text, yet the OCR output suggests bounding boxes with text, all of which are empty. "

The output of the pose-estimation operation is an empty list, which is appropriate as there are no human bodies or keypoints to detect. "
"png_pose_estimation_20","pose-estimation","test_files_wikimedia/png/pose-estimation/05_A_setiset_with_duplicated_piece.png","CORRECT","1.0","The image does not contain any human figures, so the empty output for pose-estimation is correct. "
"webp_object_detection_21","object-detection","test_files_wikimedia/webp/object-detection/02_webp_lossy.webp","SUSPICIOUS","0.85","The first bounding box correctly identifies a person in the image, who is partially obscured by water. The second bounding box, however, does not appear to contain a person or any discernible object. "
"webp_object_detection_22","object-detection","test_files_wikimedia/webp/object-detection/05_webp_lossy.webp","SUSPICIOUS","0.7","The image contains multiple people, including a fire performer in the foreground. The bounding boxes detected do not accurately cover all visible people. The main performer is partially covered, and some boxes seem to be false positives or inaccurately placed. "
"webp_ocr_23","ocr","test_files_wikimedia/webp/ocr/01_webp_lossy.webp","INCORRECT","1.0","The OCR output does not match the image content. The image is a landscape with no visible text. "

"mp3_transcription_25","transcription","test_files_wikimedia/mp3/transcription/02_Carla_Scaletti_on_natural_sounds_and_physical_modeling_(1999).mp3","SUSPICIOUS","0.9","The transcription output is mostly coherent and the structure makes sense for a transcription operation. However, there is a notable error in the text where 'Blaine' is mentioned, which seems out of context and likely a transcription error. The rest of the text is coherent and follows a logical flow discussing natural and synthetic sounds. The values for language probability and quality score are plausible. There are no speaker segments or embeddings to evaluate in this output. "

"wav_transcription_27","transcription","test_files_wikimedia/wav/transcription/03_LL-Q150_(fra)-WikiLucas00-audio.wav","CORRECT","0.9","The transcription output is semantically reasonable. The structure of the output is appropriate for a transcription operation, with a clear segmentation of the text and associated metadata. The values for language probability and quality score are plausible, indicating a moderate confidence in the language detection and transcription quality. The text 'Good job.' is coherent and not gibberish. There is no diarization or embeddings information to evaluate in this output. "
"wav_transcription_28","transcription","test_files_wikimedia/wav/transcription/01_01a_rodzaje_sygnalow_alarmowych.wav","SUSPICIOUS","0.9","The transcription output appears to be suspicious due to several issues. The repeated '[Music]' segments with varying timestamps suggest a potential error in the transcription process, as it is unlikely that the audio would consist solely of repeated '[Music]' tags. Additionally, the '[BLANK_AUDIO]' segment at the end is unusual and may indicate a problem with the transcription or the audio input. The language probability is relatively low at 0.5567, which may suggest uncertainty in language detection. The quality score is reasonably high at 0.8422, but the overall structure and content raise concerns about the accuracy and coherence of the transcription. "
"wav_transcription_29","transcription","test_files_wikimedia/wav/transcription/02_03a_rodzaje_sygnalow_alarmowych.wav","SUSPICIOUS","0.9","The transcription output is suspicious due to several issues. The 'text' field and each 'segment' contain only '[Music]', which suggests that the audio might have been music or non-speech sounds. However, the 'words' array within each segment contains timestamps and probabilities for the words '[', 'Music', and ']', which is unusual and suggests a potential error in the transcription process. The language probability is also quite low (0.3718), indicating uncertainty about the language. Additionally, the 'end' times for the 'words' do not align with the 'end' times of the segments, which is inconsistent. "
