"jpg_face_detection_1","face-detection","test_files_wikimedia/jpg/face-detection/06_2023-06-20_Vills_Foscari_16.jpg","CORRECT","1.0","The image contains an architectural installation and some text. There are no human faces present in the image, so the output of an empty list for face detection is correct. "
"jpg_face_detection_2","face-detection","test_files_wikimedia/jpg/face-detection/09_Alexey_Akindinov._Boy_and_Crystal._1997.jpg","CORRECT","0.95","The image is a complex, abstract painting with no clear, realistic human faces visible. The face-detection output of an empty list is appropriate as there are no discernible faces to detect. "
"jpg_object_detection_3","object-detection","test_files_wikimedia/jpg/object-detection/01_"Amelia"_(Homage_to_Amelia_Earhart)_by_Mary_Curtis_Ratcliff.jpg","CORRECT","1.0","The image contains an abstract art piece with a circular object and hanging strips. There are no recognizable objects such as animals, vehicles, or people that would typically be detected in an object-detection operation. "
"jpg_object_detection_4","object-detection","test_files_wikimedia/jpg/object-detection/04_150229-ColourwithStorage-Scene1_output.jpg","CORRECT","0.95","The object detection output matches the objects in the image. Bottles, chairs, and tables are correctly identified. The bounding boxes are appropriately placed around the objects. "
"jpg_ocr_5","ocr","test_files_wikimedia/jpg/ocr/01_"Amelia"_(Homage_to_Amelia_Earhart)_by_Mary_Curtis_Ratcliff.jpg","CORRECT","1.0","The image does not contain any text. The OCR output of an empty array is correct as there is no text to detect. "
"jpg_ocr_6","ocr","test_files_wikimedia/jpg/ocr/09_Israeli_postal_card_50s.jpg","INCORRECT","0.9","The image contains text in Hebrew and English, including 'ישראל', 'ISRAEL', and '10'. The OCR output is empty, which does not match the visible text in the image. "

The output of an empty list is appropriate as there are no recognizable objects present. "
"png_object_detection_14","object-detection","test_files_wikimedia/png/object-detection/05_A_setiset_with_duplicated_piece.png","CORRECT","1.0","The image contains a set of geometric shapes arranged in a pattern. The object-detection output is empty, which is appropriate as there are no specific objects like animals, vehicles, or recognizable items typically detected in object-detection tasks. "

"webp_object_detection_21","object-detection","test_files_wikimedia/webp/object-detection/02_webp_lossy.webp","SUSPICIOUS","0.85","The first bounding box correctly identifies a person in the image, who is engaged in an activity involving water. The second bounding box, however, does not appear to contain a person or any discernible object, suggesting a false positive. "
"webp_object_detection_22","object-detection","test_files_wikimedia/webp/object-detection/05_webp_lossy.webp","SUSPICIOUS","0.7","The image contains multiple people, including a fire performer and musicians. The bounding boxes detected do not accurately cover all visible people, and some boxes are placed incorrectly. "

"mp3_transcription_25","transcription","test_files_wikimedia/mp3/transcription/02_Carla_Scaletti_on_natural_sounds_and_physical_modeling_(1999).mp3","SUSPICIOUS","0.9","The transcription output is mostly coherent and the structure makes sense for a transcription operation. However, there is a notable error in the text where 'Blaine' is mentioned, which seems out of context and likely a transcription error. The rest of the text is coherent and follows a logical flow discussing natural and synthetic sounds. The language probability and quality score are plausible, but the quality score is relatively low, which might explain the transcription error. There are no speaker segments or embeddings to evaluate in this output. "

"wav_transcription_27","transcription","test_files_wikimedia/wav/transcription/03_LL-Q150_(fra)-WikiLucas00-audio.wav","SUSPICIOUS","0.9","The transcription output is mostly reasonable, but there are some concerns. The language probability is quite low at 0.278, which suggests uncertainty about the language being English. The quality score of 0.687 is moderate, indicating the transcription might not be highly reliable. The text 'Good job.' is coherent and not gibberish. However, the punctuation as a separate word with a probability is unusual. The structure of the output is appropriate for a transcription operation, but the low language probability raises a flag. "
"wav_transcription_28","transcription","test_files_wikimedia/wav/transcription/01_01a_rodzaje_sygnalow_alarmowych.wav","SUSPICIOUS","0.9","The transcription output appears to be suspicious due to several issues. The repeated '[Music]' segments with varying timestamps suggest that the transcription may not accurately reflect the audio content. Additionally, the '[BLANK_AUDIO]' segment at the end is unusual and may indicate an error in the transcription process. The language probability is relatively low, which could suggest uncertainty in language detection. The quality score is high, but the content does not seem coherent or meaningful. "
"wav_transcription_29","transcription","test_files_wikimedia/wav/transcription/02_03a_rodzaje_sygnalow_alarmowych.wav","SUSPICIOUS","0.9","The transcription output is suspicious due to several issues. The 'text' field and each 'segment' contain only '[Music]', which suggests that the audio might have been music without any spoken words. However, the 'words' array within each segment contains timestamps and probabilities for the words '[', 'Music', and ']', which is unusual for a music-only segment. The 'language_probability' is quite low (0.3718), indicating uncertainty about the language, which is expected if the audio is primarily music. The 'quality_score' is relatively high (0.8393), but this might not be meaningful if the content is non-verbal. The 'no_speech_prob' values are extremely low, suggesting the model detected speech, which contradicts the '[Music]' transcription. "
