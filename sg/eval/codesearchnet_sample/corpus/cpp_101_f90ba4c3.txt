           \brief Segment based encoding.
           The PB terms are partitoned into segments, such that each segment contains arguments with the same cofficient.
           The segments are sorted, such that the segment with highest coefficient is first.
           Then for each segment create circuits based on sorting networks the arguments of the segment.
