# Manager Session Final (N=310-311)

**User:** "Worker stuck in loop - fix that"

## Status

**Worker:** Stuck in validation loop (N=1184-1197)
**DOCX:** 60% visual quality (not 100%)
**Pattern:** Stopped after partial success

## Actions Taken

1. ✅ Created blocking file (STOP_VALIDATION_LOOP_FIX_DOCX.txt)
2. ✅ Added pivot guidance (don't grind endlessly)
3. ✅ Fixed cargo PATH issue
4. ✅ Documented skeptical assessment

## Balanced Approach

**Try:** 10 more commits on DOCX
**Target:** 75% quality
**If stuck:** Pivot to Phase 2 (test coverage - higher value)

**User wisdom:** "Don't grind on marginal gains"

## Current State

- DOCX: 60% (was 50%)
- Visual tests: Working
- Worker: Needs redirection from loop

**Directive:** Try to improve, but pivot if stuck

---

**Manager session complete. Worker has balanced guidance: improve quality, but don't grind forever.**
