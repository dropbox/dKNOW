🚨 MANAGER ACTION REQUIRED 🚨

Visual tests have been FIXED (N=1116) but need verification.

WHAT WAS FIXED:
1. Path bug: ../../test-corpus/ → test-corpus/
2. Command bug: "docling" → "cargo run --release --bin docling-cli"

CODE COMPILES: ✅ (cargo check passed 21.30s)

MANAGER MUST RUN TESTS:
=========================

1. Set API key:
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

2. Run tests:
   cargo test --test visual_quality_tests -- --nocapture --ignored

3. Expected output:
   ✅ Converting DOCX to PDF... (works)
   ✅ Parsing DOCX to markdown... (works)
   ✅ Converting markdown to PDF... (works)
   ✅ Comparing PDFs visually... (works)
   ✅ Visual Quality Score: XX.X%

4. If tests pass with scores:
   - Document scores in git commit
   - Remove VISUAL_TESTS_ACTUALLY_BROKEN.txt
   - Remove this file (MANAGER_ACTION_REQUIRED_VISUAL_TESTS.txt)

5. If tests still fail:
   - Document exact error message
   - AI will investigate further

COST: ~$0.04-0.08 (4 tests × $0.01-0.02 each)
TIME: ~5-8 minutes total (1-2 min per test)

AI CANNOT RUN THESE TESTS (no OPENAI_API_KEY access)
