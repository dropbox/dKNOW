🚨 NO SKIPPED TESTS + 95% MINIMUM - NO EXCEPTIONS 🚨

MANAGER JUST RAN TESTS:
- DOCX: 92% ❌ NOT ENOUGH
- XLSX: 87% ❌ NOT ENOUGH
- CSV: SKIPPED ⚠️ UNACCEPTABLE

---

## 92% IS FAILURE

92% means missing 8% of content.
That's F-GRADE quality.

USER IS CLEAR: 95% MINIMUM.
Anything less is BROKEN.

---

## NO SKIPPED TESTS

CSV test skipped??
UNACCEPTABLE.

EVERY test must run.
EVERY test must pass.
NO SKIPPING.

Fix whatever causes skips:
- File paths
- Dependencies
- API keys
- Anything

ALL TESTS MUST RUN.
