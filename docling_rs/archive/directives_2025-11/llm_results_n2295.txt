=== ODP Mode 3 Quality Verification ===
Overall Score: 90.0%
Passed: false

Category Scores:
  Completeness: 100/100
  Accuracy: 100/100
  Structure: 90/100
  Formatting: 90/100
  Metadata: 100/100

Findings:
  [Minor] Structure: The slide titles are not clearly delineated as separate sections in markdown, which could affect clarity.
      Location: Slide 1, Slide 2, Slide 3
  [Minor] Formatting: The slides could benefit from clearer separation, such as using horizontal rules or additional spacing.
      Location: Between slides

LLM Reasoning: The parser output effectively captures all important content and metadata from the ODP file. However, the organization of slides could be improved for better clarity in markdown format, and the formatting could be enhanced to visually separate the slides more distinctly.

  Accuracy: 100/100
  Structure: 90/100
  Formatting: 80/100

  [Major] Formatting: Paragraphs are not clearly delineated in markdown format; additional formatting for lists or breaks could improve readability.
      Location: Paragraphs

LLM Reasoning: The parser output captures the essential content and metadata from the ODT document, but there are minor issues with the organization of content and formatting that affect overall readability.

  Structure: 80/100
  Formatting: 90/100

  [Minor] Structure: The logical organization could be improved by separating the vCard version and format information into distinct sections.
      Location: Content Organization

LLM Reasoning: The parser output captures most of the important content from the input document, but it lacks a clear representation of the vCard version and format. The overall structure is somewhat logical, but could benefit from clearer separation of information.
