=== OBJ Mode 3 Quality Verification ===
Overall Score: 88.0%
Passed: false

Category Scores:
  Completeness: 95/100
  Accuracy: 95/100
  Structure: 80/100
  Formatting: 90/100
  Metadata: 100/100

Findings:
  [Major] Structure: The output lacks a clear section for the vertex and face definitions, which could help in understanding the geometry better.
      Location: Geometry Statistics

LLM Reasoning: The parser output captures most of the important content from the input document and presents it in a logical markdown format. However, it does not clearly separate the vertex and face definitions, which affects the overall structure. The accuracy and completeness are high, and the formatting is mostly correct, but the structure could be improved for better clarity.

Findings:
  [Minor] Accuracy: The total size of the archive is stated as 7168 bytes, but the breakdown of content and overhead does not add up correctly.
      Location: Archive Summary
  [Minor] Structure: The organization of the archive summary could be clearer, as it mixes file count and size information without clear separation.
      Location: Archive Summary

LLM Reasoning: The parser output effectively captures the essential content and metadata from the TAR file, but there are minor inaccuracies in the size calculations and some structural clarity issues in the summary section.

Findings:
  [Major] Completeness: Some sections of the resume, such as the heading and certain experience details, are incomplete or missing.
      Location: Heading and Experience Section
  [Major] Structure: The logical organization of sections is not preserved; for example, the Projects section appears before the Experience section.
      Location: Overall Document Structure
  [Major] Formatting: Markdown formatting for lists and tables is incorrect; items are not properly formatted as lists.
      Location: Experience and Projects Sections
  [Minor] Metadata: The author's name is present but lacks proper formatting and context.
      Location: Heading
