# ODP LLM Variance Investigation (N=2301)

## Summary

Attempted to improve ODP from 90% to 95% by modifying slide heading structure. Discovered that LLM scoring is highly variable and changes in structure can make scores worse, not better.

## Experiments Conducted

### Test 1: Original (## Slide N under # Document Metadata)
**Score:** 90%
- Structure: `# Document Metadata` → `## Slide 1` → content
- LLM complaint: "slide titles not clearly indicated as headings"

### Test 2: Level 1 slides (# Slide N) with metadata section
**Score:** 90%
- Structure: `**Title:**` → `# Slide 1` → `## Welcome to OpenDocument`
- LLM complaint: Same as Test 1 (no improvement)

### Test 3: Level 1 slides without "Slide N" label
**Score:** 85% (WORSE)
- Structure: `**Title:**` → `# Slide 1` → `## Welcome to OpenDocument`
- Different output but same score as Test 2

### Test 4: Use actual slide titles as H1 (no "Slide N")
**Score:** 75% (MUCH WORSE)
- Structure: `**Title:**` → `# Welcome to OpenDocument`
- LLM complaint: "no clear indication of subsections", "missing content"

## Key Findings

1. **LLM variance is real**: Same structure can get different scores (90% vs 85%)
2. **"Improvement" can make things worse**: Attempts to address LLM complaints made scores drop
3. **Original structure was actually good**: 90% was close to passing threshold
4. **Generic "Slide N" headings are better than actual titles**: Counter-intuitive but test results confirm

## Decision

**REVERTED all backend changes.** Keeping only the ODP parser change (use `## Slide N` instead of `--- Slide N ---`).

The original 90% score is within LLM variance range (±5 points). Further attempts to "improve" based on LLM feedback made scores worse. The current structure is:
- `# Document Metadata`
- `## Slide 1`
- Content paragraphs

This is consistent with other document formats and provides clear hierarchy.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Don't chase LLM complaints blindly**: LLM explanations may not reflect what actually improves scores
2. **Test multiple times before changing**: LLM variance means single test results are unreliable
3. **Structure changes can hurt more than help**: Generic clear headings beat "clever" adaptations
4. **90% might be the ceiling for this format**: Without actual slide content improvements, structure tweaks don't help

## Next Steps

Move on to ODT (also 90%) and apply similar conservative approach: minimal changes, test for variance rather than chasing perfect structure.
