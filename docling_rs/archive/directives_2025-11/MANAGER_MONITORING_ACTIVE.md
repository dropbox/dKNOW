## Intervention Triggers

### 🟢 GREEN - No Action Needed
- Worker making progress (commits appearing)
- Following task sequence
- Tests passing
- Timeline on track (1 day per task roughly)

### 🟡 YELLOW - Monitor Closely
- Worker stuck >4 hours on same issue
- Compilation errors accumulating
- Tests failing and not being fixed
- Timeline slipping >50%

**Action:** Check on worker, offer guidance

### 🔴 RED - Immediate Intervention
- Worker deviating from plan (skipping tasks)
- Worker marking tasks "complete" without doing them
- Test pass rate <100% and worker continuing
- Worker creating PR before all 5 tasks done
