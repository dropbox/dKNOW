⚠️  FIX_36_FAILURES_ONE_BY_ONE.txt IS OUTDATED - DO NOT USE! ⚠️

🔴 BUG DISCOVERED N=1638: LLM parser had bug that caused 0% false negatives
🔴 Many formats listed as 0% in FIX_36_FAILURES_ONE_BY_ONE.txt are actually 85%+ complete
🔴 That list needs complete re-evaluation before use

## Root Cause

LLM parser expected `category_scores` field but DocItem test prompts used `scores` field.
When parser didn't find expected field, it defaulted to all 0s.

**Fix applied**: Added serde alias in verifier.rs (N=1638)

## Known False Positives (Verified N=1638)

**VCF**: Listed 0%, actually 98% ✅
- Claims: Missing ADR, URL, BDAY fields
- Reality: All fields present since N=1621
- DO NOT attempt to "fix" - already correct

**GPX**: Listed 0%, actually 99% ✅
- Claims: Only tracks, missing waypoints/routes
- Reality: All elements present since N=1632
- DO NOT attempt to "fix" - already correct

**ICS**: Listed 0%, actually 91%
- Real minor issues: Attendee roles, VALARM structure
- Not 0%, but below 95% threshold
- Lower priority than claimed

## Estimated Impact

**10-30 formats may be incorrectly flagged as 0%.**

The entire FIX_36_FAILURES list was generated with buggy LLM parser.
Unknown how many other "failures" are actually 90%+ complete.

## ✅ COMPLETED N=1643: Re-evaluation Done!

**All 53 LLM tests re-run with fixed parser.**

**Results:**
- FIX_36_FAILURES_ONE_BY_ONE.txt archived to: `archive/FIX_36_FAILURES_ONE_BY_ONE.txt.ARCHIVED_2025-11-20`
- New accurate scores in: `LLM_QUALITY_SCORES_2025-11-20.md`
- New priority list in: `PRIORITY_FORMATS_2025-11-20.md`

**Use the new priority list, not the archived FIX_36 file!**

## How to Re-Run Tests

```bash
# Source API key
source .env

# Run all LLM DocItem validation tests
cargo test --test llm_docitem_validation_tests --package docling-core -- --exact --nocapture

# Expected cost: ~$0.03 for 53 formats
# Expected time: ~5-10 minutes
```

## What to Do Instead

**Option A (Recommended)**: Re-evaluate all formats with fixed tests
- Accurate data prevents wasted work
- Estimated 1-2 commits to generate new list
- Then proceed with real failures

**Option B**: Use backend completeness tests only
- Backend tests are deterministic and reliable
- Focus on formats with < 100% backend completeness
- LLM tests become secondary validation

**DO NOT**: Follow FIX_36 list blindly
- Will waste 60-100 commits fixing non-existent bugs
- VCF and GPX are proof that list is unreliable
