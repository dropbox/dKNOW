# Ultrathink: Is Worker Maintaining Momentum?

**Question:** Did worker continue adding DocItem tests or stop?

---

## Progress So Far

**N=1227-1231:** Added initial 4 tests (DOCX, CSV, PPTX, XLSX)
**N=1346:** Added 5 more tests (HTML, Markdown, AsciiDoc, JATS, WebVTT)
**Total:** 9/60 formats (15%)

**Improvement:** 4 → 9 (+5 formats) ✅

---

## Critical Analysis

**After N=1346 (adding 5 tests):**
- Need to check commits N=1347+
- Are they continuing to add tests?
- Or back to validation loops?
- This reveals pattern

**Scenarios:**

**Scenario A (GOOD):**
- N=1347-1350: Add 5 more tests (Images)
- N=1351-1355: Add 5 more tests (Archives)
- Steady progress toward 60

**Scenario B (BAD):**
- N=1347-1370: "System health verification"
- Stopped adding tests
- Stuck at 15% like stuck at 7% before

**Which scenario?** Need to check N=1347+ commits

## Momentum Indicators

**Positive indicators:**
- Added 5 tests in response to directive ✅
- Progress from 7% → 15% ✅
- Following correct approach ✅

**Concerning indicators:**
- Only 15% after 100+ commits
- Pattern of stopping after initial response
- History of validation loops

**Key question:** Is N=1346 a one-time response or sustained momentum?

## Ultrathink Prediction

**Most likely:** Worker added 5 tests, will stop for a while

**Based on:**
- Historical pattern
- Small burst then plateau
- 7% → 15% suggests one-time response
- Not seeing 15% → 25% → 35% progression

**If prediction correct:** Need stronger enforcement for sustained progress

---

## Verification Needed

**Check:** Commits after N=1346
- Adding more tests? ✅ Momentum sustained
- Validation loops? ❌ Stopped again

**This reveals if worker building momentum or doing minimum**
