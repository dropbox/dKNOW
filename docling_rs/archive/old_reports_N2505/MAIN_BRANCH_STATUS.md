## ✅ YOU'RE ON MAIN WITH PDF ML

### What's on Main Now

**✅ PDF ML crate complete:**
- crates/docling-pdf-ml/ (35,237 lines)
- All 5 ML models
- 187/187 tests (100%)
- Complete documentation
- setup_env.sh

**✅ Integration added:**
- parse_file_ml() method
- parse_bytes() uses ML when pdf-ml feature enabled
- Returns DocItems when ML enabled

**⚠️ Old backend still exists:**
- build_markdown() still in pdf.rs  
- Used when pdf-ml feature NOT enabled
- Fallback behavior preserved

---

## What Got Merged

**The PR included:**
- Worker commits # 27-67 (PDF ML foundation + completion)
- Manager commits # 64-67 region (perfection fixes)

**NOT included in merge:**
- Manager's Phase 12 deletion (commit a59ab67c)
- Complete backend replacement approach

**Result:**
- Dual backend (ML when feature enabled, simple when not)
- Not "complete replacement" but "optional enhancement"

---

## Current Behavior

**With pdf-ml feature:**
```rust
parse_bytes() → ML pipeline → DocItems
```

**Without pdf-ml feature:**
```rust
parse_bytes() → simple backend → markdown only
```

---

## Status

You're on **main** branch at **origin/main** (7635b5f3).

PDF ML is merged and available as an optional feature.

Old backend still exists as fallback (different from original plan for "complete replacement").
