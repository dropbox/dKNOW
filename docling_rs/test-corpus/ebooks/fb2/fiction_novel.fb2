          <p>Chapter 1: The Prophecy</p>
        </title>
        <p>The morning sun cast long shadows across the crystal plains. Young Aria stood at the edge of the cliff, gazing at the shimmering kingdom below.</p>
        <p>She had dreamed of this moment for years—the day when the prophecy would finally reveal itself.</p>
        <p><emphasis>The chosen one must rise when darkness falls</emphasis>, the ancient texts had said. But Aria never imagined that person would be her.</p>
        <empty-line/>
        <p>"Are you ready?" a voice called from behind her.</p>
        <p>Aria turned to see her mentor, Master Eldrin, approaching with his staff in hand. His weathered face showed concern, but his eyes sparkled with hope.</p>
        <p>"I don't know if I'll ever be ready," Aria replied honestly. "But I suppose that's not the point, is it?"</p>

          <p>Chapter 2: The Journey Begins</p>
        </title>
        <p>The path down the mountain was treacherous, but Aria had traveled it many times during her training.</p>
        <p>Each step brought her closer to her destiny—and closer to the unknown dangers that awaited in the Shadow Realm.</p>
        <subtitle>The First Test</subtitle>
        <p>At the mountain's base, three paths diverged. Legend spoke of only one true path, while the others led to certain doom.</p>
        <p>Aria closed her eyes and reached out with her mind, feeling for the crystal's guidance. A faint warmth pulled her to the right—the narrow path through the Whispering Woods.</p>

          <p>Chapter 3: The Whispering Woods</p>
        </title>
        <p>The forest was alive with sounds—birds chirping, leaves rustling, and underneath it all, the faint whispers that gave the woods their name.</p>
        <p>Some said the whispers were the voices of lost travelers. Others claimed they were the forest itself, speaking to those brave enough to listen.</p>
        <empty-line/>
        <p>Aria pressed forward, her hand on the crystal pendant around her neck. It glowed softly, lighting her way through the deepening shadows.</p>

          <stanza>
            <v>Through ancient trees where shadows play,</v>
            <v>The chosen one must find her way.</v>
            <v>With crystal light to guide her through,</v>
            <v>Her destiny awaits, forever true.</v>

      <p>This story was inspired by my travels through the mountains of Scotland, where I witnessed the most beautiful crystal formations in a remote cave.</p>
