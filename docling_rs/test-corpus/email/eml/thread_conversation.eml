Great feedback everyone!

Based on the discussion, I think we should proceed with:

1. OAuth 2.0 for social login (Google, GitHub, Microsoft)
2. TOTP for 2FA
3. WebAuthn/FIDO2 for passwordless (phase 2)

Mike - can you create tickets for these features?
Alex - please start the OAuth integration research.
Lisa - let's schedule a security review meeting for next week.

Thanks,
Sarah

I agree with Alex's points. OAuth 2.0 is definitely the way to go for social login.
For 2FA, I'd recommend TOTP over SMS-based verification for better security.

Hi team,

Regarding user authentication, I propose we implement the following:

- Social login via OAuth 2.0 (Google, GitHub, Microsoft)
- Traditional email/password with bcrypt hashing
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) option
- Password reset via email token

Thoughts?

Alex
