Monday, July 7:

About 0300 hours, I arrived at the location mentioned above. Upon my arrival, I noticed a black sports coupe and a black sedan parked in the driveway. All the lights inside the residence were off.

At 0345 hours, I noticed a light coming on inside the house, and I could see someone moving inside.

At approximately 0415 hours, I observed the claimant exit the residence, get into the black sedan while holding a small bag, and drive away. I followed until we arrived at 333 Mercor Circle at around 0450 hours. The claimant exited his vehicle and walked into a building that had a sign reading "We Make Metal."

At 0600 hours, I saw the claimant working; he was carrying what appeared to be a big piece of metal material while wearing full construction gear. Other employees were also working with metal, indicating this was a business in operation.

At 0830 hours, I observed the male bend down to pick up a very large box. After lifting it, he walked with the box for about three minutes before reaching a different area of the facility. Once he placed the box where it belonged, he went back inside the building and was out of sight.

At approximately 1200 hours, the male exited with several workers, holding his bag, and sat in an area with a table to eat lunch. They finished eating around 1230 hours.

At 1400 hours, I noticed the claimant on his knees, hammering a large piece of metal. He continued this for the next thirty minutes before returning inside the building.

At 1700 hours, I saw the claimant lifting what appeared to be a very heavy piece of metal with the help of another coworker.

At 1800 hours, the claimant walked over to his black sedan and drove away. By approximately 1830 hours, we arrived at his home, where he parked the black sedan next to his black sports coupe and entered his house.

At 1930 hours I departed due to no activity.
