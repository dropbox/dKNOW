Hello,

As discussed in today’s meeting, Floorstands are to be produced to achieve a 9/1 ship date to retailer. Based on last year, our estimate is 1228 stores, 1 unit per store.

Attaching the list of stores, as we will need the vendor to ship direct to the retailer.

Please keep me posted on any delays to this timing.

Thank you,

Sales

Hello,

I’ve sourced costs for the Floorstand elements assuming the 1228 unit forecast from sales team. The pricing will is $17.69/unit.

Pricing per component:

Base unit - $5.65/unit

Side panels - $2.24/piece (2 pieces per unit required)

Shelf strips - $1.89/unit (4 per unit required)

To be on the safe side, I’ll plan for a 5% overage on units. The total cost is $22,802.41.

Please let the sales team know the estimated costs for their activation budget.

Thanks,

Production
