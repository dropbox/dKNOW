**Interviewee:** Good morning. Well, it’s good morning from – I am in California. Good afternoon for you.

**Q:** Hello, good morning.

**Interviewee:** Good morning.  Yeah, so I run Location Solutions for Useful. And we are a division that focuses on obviously what our name says which is locating things. Because we fundamentally believe that if organizations can locate something very accurately, know where it is and what’s going with it, then they can make really good decisions about their production line, about inventory management and about ultimately generating more revenue and saving costs.

**Q:** Right.

Anne Smith, VP and GM of Location Solutions, Useful Technologies

**Interviewee:** So to that end, we visit solutions with Fair Farm where they manage cows which has been amazing in terms of both pushing the technology and really demonstrating that if you know where something is, and you know the behaviors of that thing, you really can help with, in this case, a great life for the cow and also better management for the farmer. So it is a pretty amazing solution and use of the technology.

**Q:** It is. It is really interesting.  I mean, so **\_\_\_\_1:23** if you could explain in your own words, it’s obviously also right around what technology does, but just so that I have got it for the piece, if you could talk me through exactly how the RTLS tracking works.

**Interviewee:** Yes, so it takes three things to make RFID work:  You put a tag on the thing you want to track; you put what’s called a sensor or a reader if you think about it in the physical space, so that you can read what’s going on with those tags, and then all of those readers connect to what we call an R-world a hub, but think of it as a central location for collection of all that information.

And once you have it all collected, then it can connect to any piece of software to do the analytics around what it means – now that I know the location, what does it mean?  So it is really 3 things: a tag, sensor, and a hub.  The unique part about our solution is it works with Fair Farm is it’s something called, (and I don’t want to get too technical here) but the industry term, the acronym is UWB which is ultra-wideband.  And all UWB means is it blinks really quick. That’s all. It just blinks really fast.

And if you are talking about a moving cow, even though in theory they move kind of slow, you want the rate of collecting information to happen very quickly.

And so you would want to, in this case, use tags that blink really fast.  And if you think about, for example, a passive tag on your clothes at a department store you know at H&amp;M for example, that tag doesn’t blink at all.  It only goes off when you walk through the door and you walk by a reader, and then it will say, Oh I am here why are you doing that?  That kind of passive solution wouldn’t work with cows obviously because they move too much.  And you want to know how they move within the building to be able to track it. And so the ultra-wideband technology is kind of a cool thing that makes it work.

**Q:** Right.

**Interviewee:** You could use the technology for a lot of things too if you think about it. Right in the sports vertical, you can track football players or cyclists or that kind of thing, in a mining environment where you are tracking people underground and making sure that everything’s okay, you would use the same kind of technology for things that move relatively quickly.

**Q:** And so how does this work with the tags that you are using with the cows? I mean how is your technology integrated into the system?

**Interviewee:** Yes, so the cows wear…and I think [Lars] probably talked about this, but the cows wear a tag basically around their neck and it kind of looks like a necklace really.  The cows wear a necklace. They call it a collar but it is not a collar, because when we think of a collar, we think of like a dog collar where it is tied around their neck, and it is not.  It sort of hangs down.  So they put the tag on the cow itself.  And in the system electronically, each tag has a number, #1, 2, 3… and you know that that tag belongs to Betsy the cow.

And so you would associate those things on the computer so that when you then want to look at Betsy the cow, you could see everything about that asset, you many times she has gone, walked over to the water area, how many times she has been to the food area, how many times or how much time she has spent lying down, or standing up or walking around. And interestingly enough, all of those cues matched with cow and Fair Farm’s ability to understand the science, the veterinary science about animals, they know if the cows drinks so much water or doesn’t eat or whatever, that they are getting close to calving, and having a baby, and so they can get some signals and it might be a false signal but it is certainly better than no signal at all, around what’s going on with cow.

And what [Lars] and his team have been able to do is refine and refine and refine the meaning behind the location, and it has gotten some very accurate information for the farmers, to know when to intervene with the cow, and when not to.  When they are having a baby, and when they are not.  And it is pretty amazing.

**Q:** Yeah, I know it is.  It sounds really really fascinating.  When you talk about the UWB side of things and the tags and the accuracy with which you can track the animals, I mean is your technology the only one that is doing this way at the moment?

**Interviewee:** It is actually kind of anything so obviously in each technology that is out there, you know there are other companies that do UWB technology but the key is just what you were talking about.  It is how accurate is your system and because it is three pieces, tag, sensor and the hub that collects everything, each of those pieces have to be world-class to get the best location information.

And in our case, we just for example, we made our 1 millionth tag announcement, we have a million tags out collecting information with various automotive companies, and industrial manufacturing and cows, all kinds of people tagging her up. And so I think because we have the most installed worldwide and we have the most… we are the largest company in this space so we have the most R&amp;D money to spend on it, I would say that our technology is the leader in terms of precision location.  And what’s interesting about precision location is when (this is just sort of a general point so if I am boring you can turn me off) …

Even though cows move slowly, you still want the information to come quickly. That’s why we use ultra-wideband, which just means the tags blink very fast.

**Interviewee:** But location … it started being used just in the US, the Wal-Marts of the world, and H&amp;M department stores so that clothes wouldn’t be stolen, is a great example. It wasn’t really to find something it was so you wouldn’t lose something.  And what changed in the last five years with this technology is that the benefit of instead of tracking what was lost, in tracking what you can locate and do with it, and it is just amazing how … the same analogy that Fair Farm is using here when it tracks cows in such detail is happening in automotive plants all over the world today.  And they save so much money by making better decisions around where something is, where should it be, when did it run out, how can we better replace… and so the strength of the technology with that precision locating which was your point is more critical than ever today.  It is not good enough to know that it is in the H&amp;M store, you have to know that it is on the third rack, on the second floor right here.

**Q:** Right.  Can you describe what’s inside the tags, and how that works?

**Interviewee:** Yes, the components of the tag itself it is I guess 4 things:  there is a chip that allows you to have a little memory just like a computer chip really, you need to put a little program on there, there is an antenna, much like (I don’t want to simplify it too much) but much like a radio antenna right, and that’s what reaches out to the sensor, it has a battery part, a little tiny battery in it, and when I say little tiny, I mean it is literally little tiny, the end of your pinky fingernail probably; by the way, the whole tag is like two American quarters, actually you know what it is the size of a Tums, it is a little tiny thing and it has got a battery, an antenna a chip and some plastic. It is a little tiny thing. And for example, a cow it is not going to interfere, it is not heavy, it is not complex for them (AUDIO GAP)

**Q:** When I spoke to [Dieter] this morning, he said it has a range of about 300 to 500 meters between the tag and the hub, is that right?

**Interviewee:** Yeah, that’s exactly right.  That’s between the tag and the sensor.  And the way that you do it, if you have an ever bigger area, think of like the size of an automobile plant which is huge, you just have a lot of sensors.

**Q:** Yeah, and so at the moment this is working within the barn where the cows spend time. Can it be expanded to cover pasture areas?

**Interviewee:** Yeah, it can.  And actually it is really interesting. So these solutions, the benefit of having RTLS or radiofrequency solutions is that it can work inside or outside. One of the challenges to location solutions that use something like GPS because there are some, if you think about the things that track trucks on an open road, those are GPS solutions. And the challenge of GPS is you would have to be able to triangulate with a satellite, so it has got to work outside, it can’t work inside.  So the benefit of radiofrequency is it can work inside and outside – no problem.

So yes, you can put up sensors on a pole, outside in a pasture, and the sensor itself (if you think about it is probably the size of like an alarm clock) it is tiny it is not that big, so it can go up on a pole or on a tree, and it can be powered with solar so you don’t have to worry about cabling your pasture, which will be very strange.  And so you can put it up there, and you can track what’s going on in the pasture. And that is the benefit.  And it is a single system, right, so you don’t have to train your farmer how to do anything different, it is all the same, inside outside doesn’t matter.

It takes three things to make RFID work. You put a tag on the cow, you install sensors to pick up the signals, and all of those readers connect to a hub, which is like a central location for collecting the data. Once you have that, you can connect it to software that interprets what the information actually means.

**Q:** And is there anything else that you could use the tags to track?  Are there any plans to sort to expand the data that they collect?

**Interviewee:** For Fair Farm? Or in general?

**Q:** Yes. Both really.

**Interviewee:** Yes, so for Fair Farm I think they have really interesting plans around improving the health, safety and care taking of the cows, and they are so focused on it.  And I would say that those kinds of questions you should ask []\_ only because he is such an expert in the veterinary science of what they are trying to achieve.  But in terms of other applications, it is really kind of interesting because radiofrequency tags these kinds of tags they frankly have been around for 10 years, I mean this has been in market it is almost like the early days of mobile applications, I don’t know if you remember, but everyone was saying ‘Oh nobody is going to use applications on their phones, that’s impossible,’ and you know, look where we are today.  So RF has kind of been like that.

This is a technology that has been around for a long time, and it was really used to not lose things, and the value of not losing something isn’t that big, frankly.  And it has only been in the last maybe 10 years that people have gotten really good at understanding -’Wait a minute, if I know where something is, and I know what’s going on with it, I have visibility into my value chain and my production line as to what’s going on.’

To give you some really interesting things that are going on in automotives, if an automotive plant uses, and they do,  and they use what’s called like a big rack, and think of a big rack as something that will hold like dashboards, right, and they don’t make the dashboards, a third party company makes the dashboards for them, but they own the rack, so they tag the rack and send it to their supplier and that rack is taking too long to come back, then you actually know that there is a problem at your supplier before anyone ever calls you. And those are the kinds of things that are coming together in the automotive and industrial engineering world.

And in fact, what we are seeing with our customers is that they are beginning to add company titles to people, or designate somebody within the company called ‘global visibility manager’ or ‘production visibility manager’, and their job is to come up with ways to use technology like this, and sensors temperature sensors and all of those things, the sort of Internet of things to turn the physical into the digital so that they can then know what to do.  And make better decisions.  And it is pretty amazing.  It has taken a long time to get here, but it is amazing value of the data.

**Q:** Yeah, absolutely. And so at the moment, the technology is being used in Europe, and it is just about to expand into the UK, I believe?

**Interviewee:** Yeah, that’s why Fair Farm is trying to move to the UK, and in fact by the way, Fair Farm is a very large, a $5 billion company, and so they plan on going worldwide with it as well.  And if you think about it, in the dairy industry, that is one of the industries where the price of milk is so regulated and managing costs in the supply chain of milk is just so critical.

**Q:** Yeah.  What kind of savings do you think that farmers are likely to see using this kind of technology?  I don’t know if you can speak on this.

**Interviewee:** You know, I don’t think I know the answer to that question.  As it relates to Fair Farm overall, but what we’ve seen though in the automotive industrial manufacturing area where we are close to those numbers because we do a lot of application work in that space, they can save 10 to 15 percent a year by simply getting that lean manufacturing, just-in-time inventory process even more accurate.

**Q:** Yeah.  That’s great.

“You can see how many times she has been to the water trough, how often she’s been lying down or standing up, or how far she has walked,” she says.

“When you connect that data with veterinary knowledge, you start to see patterns, such as when a cow is close to calving.”

Smith notes that ultra-wideband is used far beyond agriculture.

“It started in retail, to stop clothes going missing,” she says.

“But in the last few years people have realised that if you know exactly where something is, you can make far better decisions. The same principle that helps farmers track cows is saving millions in automotive plants.”
