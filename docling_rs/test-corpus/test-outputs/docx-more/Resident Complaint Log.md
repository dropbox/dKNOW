**Feedback** : I’m writing about the toilet. John came on 04/05  for a repair, but water still keeps running constantly. I really need this fixed — my water bill is going to be insane. After the initial repair,  I left numerous follow-up comments under the same maintenance request that the water running issue still persists. He never responded. Please assist ASAP!

**Feedback:** Earlier today, when I tried to show John the faucet was still dripping after he “fixed” it, he just sighed and said, “It’s an old building, these things happen!” He seemed quite annoyed that I was even showing him the leak. It made me feel like I was bothering him. I waited three days for him to show up in the first place, and the job isn’t even done!

Apartment: 7B **Feedback:** I submitted a request for a broken kitchen cabinet hinge. The request was never acknowledged with any update, and nobody reached out to schedule a time for repair. Yesterday, I received a notification that the work order was complete. The super must have closed my ticket by mistake. So frustrating!
