RE:  Requested pricing for GloNGroRealEstate Companies Marketplace

Hi Taylor,

Great to re-connect with you and thank you for alerting us to the opportunity with GloNGroRealEstate Companies Marketplace. Per our phone conversation, I agree that a conservative estimate of volume in year one would be 2000 units of the HVAC duct product and 2000 units of the Ceiling product, along with consumable parts used on annual basis.

Please find proposed retail pricing for the marketplace and product cost based on that volume range.

Additionally, VerteCleanUV can also offer a 15% discount on products once GloNGroRealEstate has purchased units in excess of the 1000 quantity threshold.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you need any additional information. I look forward to working with you again on this project!

Best,

Bob Johnson
