Subject: Thermal Characterization of C/SiC Heat Shield Panel for Forward Edge Assembly (FEA)

## 1. Background

As part of an ongoing development effort for a reusable forward-edge protection system, a carbon/silicon carbide (C/SiC) composite tile is being evaluated for thermal durability during high-Mach exposure. This panel is intended for placement near the stagnation region of an experimental flight article.

The design is subject to convective heating from external flow and mild cooling from internal airflow within the equipment bay. To reduce cost and time, a 2D thermal network simulation (22-node model) is being used as a screening tool to estimate back-face temperature rise during a mission-representative heating event.

## 2. Objective

Determine whether the proposed heat shield geometry, material, and boundary conditions maintain back-face temperatures below the 150 ¡C limit during a 20-minute exposure to severe convective heating.

## 3. Task Description

The Materials Lab is requested to:

1. Review the provided 22-node in-plane conduction model for adequacy.
2. Evaluate temperature response at key nodes for the following conditions:
3. o
4. Timepoints: 0.5, 5, 10, and 20 minutes
5. o Material: C/SiC (k = 5.0 W/m · K, ρ = 2200 kg/m ³ , cp = 800 J/kg · K)
6. o External conditions: Ti = 700 ¡C, hi = 1200 W/m ²· K
7. o Internal cooling: To = 25 ¡C, ho = 15 W/m ²· K
8. o Node spacing: 0.05 m
3. Generate the following deliverables:
- a. Node temperature profiles vs time
- b. Contour plot (isotherms) at 20 minutes
- c. Time traces for representative nodes (e.g., node 1, 13, 22)
- d. Summary of max back-face temperatures at each time
4. Assess risk of back-face limit exceedance based on provided data.
5. Recommend mitigations if temperature margin is under 10 ¡C
