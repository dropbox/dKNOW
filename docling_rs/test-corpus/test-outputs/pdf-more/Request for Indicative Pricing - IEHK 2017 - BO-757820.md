Subject: Request for Indicative Pricing - IEHK 2017

Dear MedWholeGroup Sales Team,

We are currently evaluating potential suppliers for the Interagency Emergency Health Kit (IEHK 2017), as part of our preparedness planning for future deployments.

At this stage, we would like to request indicative pricing and availability for the individual modules you can offer.

Please provide pricing per module, as well as any relevant information on availability, lead times, and shelf life. As we are still assessing internal needs, we do not yet have confirmed quantities or destination countries. For now, we kindly request pricing on an Ex-Works (EXW) basis, without transport costs.

We are not yet familiar with the specific structure of the IEHK and would appreciate any supporting documentation or references to official specifications.

Thank you in advance for your support. Please do not hesitate to contact us should you require any clarification.

Kind regards, Patrick O'Conor
