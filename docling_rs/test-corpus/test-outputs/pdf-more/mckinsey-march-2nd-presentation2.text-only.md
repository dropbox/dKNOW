- Privatization:  An unlikely option for USPS
- Investors require a clear path to profitability before acquisition
- Changes USPS requires to become attractive to investors are more extensive than those required to ensure a viable government entity
- The scale and associated risk further limit investor interest in the business

Fundamental change: Public policy considerations

- Restructure RHB pre-funding ▪ Defer payments

Streamline oversight model to

improve flexibility and timeliness

Closing perspective

Even undertaking all opportunities within Postal Service control, USPS is facing a cumulative $115 billion loss

Actions in any one area will not be enough to close this gap

Pursuing multiple actions can result in enhanced customer service and a financially viable operating model

Legislative and regulatory changes are necessary and will require cooperation

from multiple stakeholders
