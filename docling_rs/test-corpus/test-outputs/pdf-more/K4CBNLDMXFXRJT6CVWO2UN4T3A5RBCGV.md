## ABOUT THIS GUIDE

Congratulations on your purchase of the 24-Port 10/100/1000Mbps + 2  Combo  Mini  GBIC  Gigabit  Smart  Switch.  This  device  integrates 1000Mbps  Gigabit  Ethernet,  100Mbps  Fast  Ethernet  and  10Mbps Ethernet network capabilities in a highly flexible package.

## Purpose

This  guide  discusses  how  to  install  and  configure  the  DGS-1224T Web Smart Switch.

## Terms/Usage

In this guide, the term 'Switch' (first letter upper case) refers to your DGS-1224T Web Smart Switch, and 'switch' (first letter lower case) refers to other Ethernet switches.

## INTRODUCTION

This  chapter  describes  the  features  of  the  DGS-1224T  and  some background information about Ethernet/Fast Ethernet/Gigabit Ethernet switching technology.

## Gigabit Ethernet Technology

Gigabit Ethernet is an extension of IEEE 802.3 Ethernet utilizing the same packet structure, format, and support for CSMA/CD protocol, full duplex, flow control, and management objects, but with a tenfold increase in theoretical throughput over 100-Mbps Fast Ethernet and a hundredfold increase over 10-Mbps Ethernet. Since it is compatible with  all  10-Mbps  and  100-Mbps  Ethernet  environments,  Gigabit Ethernet provides a straightforward upgrade  without wasting a company's  existing  investment  in  hardware,  software,  and  trained personnel.

The increased speed and extra bandwidth offered by Gigabit Ethernet is  essential  to  coping  with  the  network  bottlenecks  that  frequently develop as computers and their busses get faster and more users use applications  that  generate  more  traffic.  Upgrading  key  components, such  as  your  backbone  and  servers  to  Gigabit  Ethernet  can  greatly improve network response times as well as significantly speed up the traffic between your subnets.

Gigabit  Ethernet  enables  fast  optical  fiber  connections  to  support video  conferencing,  complex  imaging,  and  similar  data-intensive applications. Likewise, since data transfers occur 10 times faster than Fast Ethernet, servers outfitted with Gigabit Ethernet NIC's are able to perform 10 times the number of operations in the same amount of time.

In addition, the phenomenal bandwidth delivered by Gigabit Ethernet is  the  most  cost-effective  method  to  take  advantage  of  today  and

tomorrow's rapidly improving switching and routing internetworking technologies.  And  with  expected  advances  in  the  coming  years  in silicon  technology  and  digital  signal  processing  that  will  enable Gigabit  Ethernet  to  eventually  operate  over  unshielded  twisted-pair (UTP) cabling, outfitting your network with a powerful 1000-Mbpscapable backbone/server connection creates a flexible foundation for the next generation of network technology products.

## Fast Ethernet Technology

The growing importance of LANs and the increasing complexity of desktop computing applications are fueling the need for high performance  networks.  A  number  of  high-speed  LAN  technologies have been proposed to provide greater bandwidth  and  improve client/server response times. Among  them, 100BASE-T  (Fast Ethernet) provides a non-disruptive, smooth  evolution from the current  10BASE-T  technology.    The  non-disruptive  and  smooth evolution nature, and the dominating potential market base, virtually guarantees cost-effective and high performance Fast Ethernet solutions.

100Mbps  Fast  Ethernet  is  a  standard  specified  by  the  IEEE  802.3 LAN committee.  It is an extension of the 10Mbps Ethernet standard with  the  ability  to  transmit  and  receive  data  at  100Mbps,  while maintaining  the  CSMA/CD  Ethernet  protocol.  Since  the  100Mbps Fast Ethernet is compatible with all other 10Mbps Ethernet environments, it provides a straightforward upgrade and takes advantage  of  the  existing  investment  in  hardware,  software,  and personnel training.

## Switching Technology

Another approach to pushing beyond the limits of Ethernet technology is the development  of  switching  technology.  A  switch bridges Ethernet packets at the MAC address level of the Ethernet protocol transmitting among connected Ethernet or Fast Ethernet  LAN segments.

Switching  is  a  cost-effective  way  of  increasing  the  total  network capacity available to users on a local area network.  A switch increases capacity  and  decreases  network  loading  by  dividing  a  local  area network into different segments, which don't compete with each other for network transmission capacity.

The  switch  acts  as  a  high-speed selective bridge between  the individual  segments.    The  switch,  without  interfering  with  any  other segments,  automatically  forwards  traffic  that  needs  to  go  from  one segment  to  another.    By  doing  this  the  total  network  capacity  is multiplied,  while  still  maintaining  the  same  network  cabling  and adapter cards.

Switching LAN  technology  is  a  marked  improvement  over  the previous generation of network bridges, which were characterized by higher latencies.  Routers have also been used to segment local area networks, but the cost of a router, the setup and maintenance required make  routers  relatively  impractical.    Today  switches  are  an  ideal solution to most kinds of local area network congestion problems.

## VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)

A VLAN is a group of end-stations that are not constrained by their physical  location  and  can  communicate  as  if  a  common  broadcast domain,  a  LAN.  The  primary  utility  of  using  VLAN  is  to  reduce latency  and  need  for  routers,  using  faster  switching  instead.  Other VLAN utility includes:

Security, Security  is  increased  with  the  reduction  of  opportunity  in eavesdropping on a broadcast network because data will be switched to only those confidential users within the VLAN.

Cost  Reduction, VLANs  can  be  used  to  create  multiple  broadcast domains, thus eliminating the need of expensive routers.

Port-based (or port-group) VLAN  is the common method of implementing a VLAN, and is the one supplied in the Switch.

- u Quick Installation Guide

If  any  item  is  found  missing  or  dama ged, please contact your local reseller for replacement.

## Installation

The  site  where  you  install  the  hub  stack  may  greatly  affect  its performance. When installing, consider the following pointers:

Install  the  Switch  in  a  fairly  cool  and  dry  place.    See Technical Specifications for the acceptable temperature and humidity operating ranges.

Install  the  Switch  in  a  site  free  from  strong  electromagnetic  field generators (such as motors), vibration, dust, and direct exposure to

sunlight.

Leave  at  least  10cm  of  space  at  the  front  and  rear  of  the  hub  for ventilation.

Install the Switch on a sturdy, level surface that can support its weight, or in an EIA standard-size equipment rack.  For information on rack installation, see the next section, Rack Mounting .

When installing the Switch on a level surface, attach the rubber feet to the  bottom  of  each  device.    The  rubber  feet  cushion  the  hub  and protect the hub case from scratching.

Figure 1. Attach the adhesive rubber pads to the bottom

<!-- image -->

## Rack Mounting

The  switch  can  be  mounted  in  an  EIA  standard-size,  19-inch  rack, which can be placed in a wiring closet with other equipment.  Attach the mounting brackets at the switch's front panel (one on each side), and secure them with the provided screws.

Figure 2. Combine the Switch with the provided screws

<!-- image -->

Then, use screws provided with the equipment rack to mount each switch in the rack.

## Connecting Network Cable

The Switch supports 1000Mbps Gigabit Ethernet that runs in Autonegotiation mode and 10Mbps Ethernet or 100Mbps Fast Ethernet that runs  both  in  half  and  full  duplex  mode  and  1000Mbps  Gigabit Ethernet runs in full duplex mode using four pair of Category 5 Cable.

These  RJ-45  ports  are  Auto-MDI  type  port.  The  Switch  can  auto transform to MDI-II or MDI-X type, so you can just make an easy connection  that  without  worrying  if  you  are  using  a  standard  or crossover RJ45 cable.

## AC Power

The Switch used the AC power supply 100-240V AC, 50-60 Hz. The power  switch  is  located  at  the  rear  of  the  unit  adjacent  to  the  AC power connector and the system fan. The switch's power supply will adjust to the local power source automatically and may be turned on without having any or all LAN segment cables connected.

Be sure that the selected trunk setting port must connect to the device with a same VLAN group.

## Mirror Setting

Port Mirroring is a method of monitoring network traffic that forwards a copy of each incoming and/or outgoing  packet from one  port of a network  switch  to  another  port  where  the  packet  can  be  studied.  It enables the  manager to keep close track of switch performance and alter it if necessary.

Configuring the port Mirroring by assigning a source port from which to copy all packets and a sniffer port where those packets will be sent.

The selection of the sniffer mode is as follow:

RX (receive) mode: this mode will duplicate the data that send to the source and forward to the sniffer port.
