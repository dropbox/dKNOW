## Referrals for NEMT Trips Beyond 'nearest facility'

NEMT Coverage Policy and Medical Necessity Documentation Information for Facilities/Providers Referring American Indian Health Plan (AIHP) (Health Plan ID number 999998) FFS Members beyond the nearest facility for AHCCCS Covered Services

AHCCCS policy limits NEMT transportation to the cost of transporting the member to the nearest appropriate IHS/Tribal 638 medical facility or nearest appropriate AHCCCS registered provider capable of meeting the member's medical needs (FFS Provider Manual Chapter 14; IHS/Tribal Provider Billing Manual Chapter 11; AMPM Chapter 800 Policy 820 W).

Transportation service must only be provided to transport the member to and from the required covered medical service (AMPM Chapter 300 policy 310 BB; Chapter 800 Policy 820 W).

When NEMT prior authorization is requested beyond what appears to be the nearest appropriate facility or provider, the PA Unit may request medical necessity justification from the

referring facility/provider to ensure that AHCCCS NEMT coverage policy is being followed appropriately (AMPM Chapter 800 Policy 820 W).

The referring facility or provider should submit the medical necessity documentation via fax directly to Division of Fee for Service Management (DFSM), not to the transportation provider. If the medical necessity documentation is not received, AHCCCS may not have the information necessary to approve the authorization request, e.g., such as in cases where the service is not available at the referring facility and/or the wait list at the nearest facility is too long to meet the member's medical needs.

Medical necessity documentation must be submitted to DFSM using a Prior Authorization Medical Documentation Form as a cover sheet, which can be found on our website under https://www.azahcccs.gov/PlansProviders/RatesAndBilling/FFS/priorauthorizationforms.html. The form with the attached medical necessity documentation should be faxed to the Transportation fax number, 602-254-2431.

## Dental Review Process for Deep Sedation/General Anesthesia

AHCCCS Fee-For-Service (FFS) transitioned from prospective review to retrospective review of dental services performed under deep sedation/general anesthesia beginning August 1 st 2016. This process change was implemented to improve the timeliness of service delivery to AHCCCS Fee-For-Service (FFS) plan members, and help reduce the administrative burden associated with an increased volume of service requests.

Dental providers performing services under deep sedation/general anesthesia submit their claims electronically to the FFS Claims area with the following documentation:

-  Dentist's Substantiation of Necessity of Services Through Depiction of Dental Condition
-  Dentist's Treatment Plan and Schedule
-  Radiographic Images Fully Depicting Existing Teeth and Associated Structures by Standard Illumination When Appropriate.

* Please note that Fee-For-Service claims found to have been reimbursed incorrectly are subject to recoupment.

Continue to submit dental prior authorization requests using the completed FFS Authorization Request form as the coversheet to your documents for the following dental services at least 7 days in advance of the date of service:

-  Removable Dental Prosthetics (including complete and removable partial dentures)
-  Cast Crowns
-  Orthodontia Services
-  Pre Transplant Dental Services

Services requiring Prior Authorization should be mailed to the AHCCCS FFS Prior Authorization area with the following documentation:

-  Completed Fee-For-Service Authorization Request form
-  Dentist's Substantiation of Necessity of Services Through Depiction of Dental Condition
-  Dentist's Treatment Plan and Schedule
-  Radiographic Images Fully Depicting Existing Teeth and Associated Structures by Standard Illumination When Appropriate. If radiographs are unavailable please document why.

Dental authorization requests should be mailed to: AHCCCS DFSM - Prior Authorization: Dental Mail Drop # 8900 701 E. Jefferson Street Phoenix, AZ 85034

## Prior Authorization Request Timeframes

AHCCCS endeavors to review all authorization requests as expeditiously as possible, but may take up to 14 calendar days to make a determination on an authorization request per A.A.C R9-34-306.

For requests that meet the criteria for an expedited decision per A.A.C R9-34-306, the decision will be issued not later than 3 working days after receipt of the request. AHCCCS will review requests for expedited decisions in order to determine whether following the 14 calendar day review timeframe could seriously jeopardize the member's life or health, or ability to attain, maintain, or regain maximum function.  Expedited requests that do not meet the criteria for an expedited decision will be processed in accordance with the 14 calendar day time frame.

When an extension is requested by the member, or if AHCCCS requires additional information to make a determination, AHCCCS may extend the timeframes for both expedited and non-expedited requests up to an additional 14 calendar days.

For authorization requests in which service delivery has already occurred, the above timeframes are not applicable.

To submit a request for an expedited decision, use AHCCCS Online to enter a pended authorization request and fax the FFS PA request or medical documentation form with the pended PA number and supporting clinical documentation to the appropriate AHCCCS fax line.  Call the FFS PA line at 602-417-4400 to notify PA staff of the pended authorization and faxed clinical documentation.
