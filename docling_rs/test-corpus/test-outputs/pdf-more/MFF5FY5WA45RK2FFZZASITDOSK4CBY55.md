Recent rainfall levels have helped to improved drought conditions, primarily in the southern part of the state. Drought Regions 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 are still declared to be at the Drought Advisory level. OWR will continue monitoring our water resources and update this Declaration as needed.

Water managers are urged to carefully monitor conditions and encourage the wise and efficient use of our water resources. Public water system customers are encouraged to follow their local water system's recommendations regarding water use. All other water users should make prudent decisions on their water use to protect available resources.
