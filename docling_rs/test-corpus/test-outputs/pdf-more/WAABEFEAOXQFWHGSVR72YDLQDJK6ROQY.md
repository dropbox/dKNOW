## Medicaid &amp; Health Benefits

The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) announced it is granting exceptions from reporting requirements and extensions for clinicians and providers participating in Medicare quality reporting programs with respect to upcoming measure reporting and data submission for those programs.

CMS released guidance regarding the increased FMAP available to states as part of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. As a reminder, Section 6008 of the act provides a temporary 6.2 percentage point increase to each qualifying state and territory's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). One noteworthy item is that for states to qualify for the FMAP increase, states cannot end coverage for anyone who is eligible as of March 18   or those who become eligible after that date until end of public health emergency, unless the individual voluntarily terminates enrollment or is no longer a resident of the state.

CMS released four Medicaid waiver templates designed to help state Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Programs (CHIP) during the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. The Medicaid waiver templates are intended to make application processes faster and decrease administrative burden as states struggle to contain the coronavirus. The materials released include checklists for the 1115 Medicaid Demonstration waiver, the 1135 waiver, a template for the 1915(c) Appendix K regarding home and community-based services, and the Medicaid Disaster State Plan Amendment.

*** Alabama Approved CMS approved Medicaid section 1135 waivers for 7 additional states in response to COVID-19. This brings the total number of approved Section 1135 waivers for states to 23. The waivers were approved within days of states' submitting them, and offer states new flexibilities to focus their resources on combatting the outbreak and providing the best possible care to Medicaid beneficiaries in their states.

CMS has withdrawn its proposed rule to crackdown on state Medicaid eligibility determinations from the Office of Management and Budget's regulatory review process. 'This proposed rule would have strengthened the integrity of the Medicaid eligibility determination process including verification, changes in circumstance, and redetermination," the agency said in its description of the rule. The proposed rule was supposed to be published in April. Healthcare experts and advocates have worried that tightening eligibility rules would make it tougher for eligible people to enroll in the program and maintain coverage, even if it reduced improper Medicaid enrollment and federal payments to states.

CMS issued Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) to clarify coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by catastrophic health plans. A catastrophic health plan generally may not provide coverage of an essential health benefit before an enrollee meets the plan's deductible. Through this FAQ, CMS is announcing that the agency will not take enforcement action against any health issuer that amends its catastrophic plans to provide coverage without imposing cost-sharing requirements for COVID-19 related services before an enrollee meets the catastrophic plan's deductible.

On Tuesday, March 24, CMS posted guidance on Payment and Grace Period Flexibilities for Issuers Offering Coverage on the Federally-facilitated Exchanges and State-based Exchanges on the Federal Platform. Under the newly released guidance, CMS announced that it will exercise enforcement discretion to permit issuers of qualified health plans (QHPs) and stand-alone dental plans (SADPs) to extend payment deadlines for initial binder payments, as well as ongoing premium payments during the period of the COVID-19 national emergency

All other taxpayers (regardless of filing status) with a federal income tax liability may delay up to $1 million in federal income tax payments. Interest, penalties and additions to tax with respect to such postponed federal income tax payments will not begin to accrue until July 16, 2020. No extension was provided for the filing of any returns or the payment or deposit of any other type of federal tax.
