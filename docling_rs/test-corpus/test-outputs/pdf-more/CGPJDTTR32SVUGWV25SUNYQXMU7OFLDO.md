## CITY COUNCIL ACTION:

City Council approved the Planning Commission recommendation with an amendment to the following condition:

## Condition 52

52. Provide and install a City standard bus-shelter, with a cost not to exceed $30,000 for the WMATA 11Y bus stop located immediately adjacent to the site to the satisfaction of the Director of T&amp;ES prior to the issuance of the first Certificate of Occupancy. The final bus shelter and bus stop bench design shall meet City standards and the approval of the Director of T&amp;ES. Design and specifications for the City standard bus shelter are at:

www.alexandriava.gov/6548. Bus shelters require a building permit. (T&amp;ES) (Code)(CC)***

## PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION:

On  a  motion  by  Commissioner  Lyle,  seconded  by  Vice  Chair  McMahon,  the  Planning Commission  voted  to  recommend  approval  of  Master  Plan  Amendment  #2023-00008.  The motion carried on a 7-0 vote.

On  a  motion  by  Commissioner  Lyle,  seconded  by  Vice  Chair  McMahon,  the  Planning Commission voted to recommend approval of Rezoning #2023-00006. The motion carried on a 7-0 vote.

On  a  motion  by  Commissioner  Lyle,  seconded  by  Vice  Chair  McMahon,  the  Planning Commission voted to recommend approval of DSUP #2023-10012 with changes to Conditions 101 and 113 in accordance with the memo sent to Planning Commission on February 5, 2024 and with a revision to Condition 52. The motion carried on a 7-0 vote.

## Reason:

While the Planning Commission was supportive about staff's recommendation for the applicant to provide a bus shelter at the nearby 11Y WMATA stop in order to meet the transit needs of the  increased  number of residents,  they  acknowledged the uncertainty related to the  cost  of providing conduit at the bus shelter to accommodate future real time LED screens. Therefore, they found it acceptable to remove that aspect of the condition related to the conduit while still providing for the purchase and installation of the physical bus shelter.

The Planning Commission agreed with staff's analysis and with the recommended changes to the following conditions:

## Condition 52

52. Provide and install a City standard bus-shelter with the ability to accommodate future real time bus information LED screens, and electric connections, with a cost not to exceed $30,000 for the WMATA 11Y bus stop located immediately adjacent to the site to the satisfaction of the

MPA#2023-00008; REZ#2023-00006; DSUP#2023-10012 1201 East Abingdon Drive

Director of T&amp;ES prior to the issuance of the first Certificate of Occupancy . The final bus shelter and bus stop bench design shall meet City standards and the approval of the Director of T&amp;ES. Design and specifications for the City standard bus shelter are at: www.alexandriava.gov/6548. Bus shelters require a building permit. (T&amp;ES) (Code) * **

## Condition 101

101. Provide seven (7) set aside rental units within the development, comprising one (1) onebedroom, four (4) one-bedroom plus den, and two (2) two-bedroom units, with a unit mix proportional to the project's total unit mix, or an substantially equivalent mix of seven units to the satisfaction of the Director of Housing to be finalized prior to the release of the Final Site Plan. For the purposes of the seta side units, dens are defined as being enclosed with a door, having a minimum of 70 square feet of floor area, being no less than seven feet in any horizontal dimension, and not housing any substantial mechanical equipment. (Housing)

## Condition 113

113. Should the project develop as or convert to residential condominiums, provide no fewer than seven (7) affordable set-aside for-sale units within the development, comprising one (1) one-bedroom unit for sale at $225,000, four (4) one-bedroom plus den units for sale at $250,000, and two (2) two-bedroom units for sale at  $275,000, with a unit mix proportional to the project's total unit mix, or a substantially equivalent mix of seven units to the satisfaction of the Director of Housing to be finalized prior to the release of the Final Site Plan. The units will be priced consistent with the City sale prices and policies in effect at the time of the application's approval by City Council. These prices include the cost of one parking space per  unit.  Set-aside  units  sold  without  a  parking  space  shall  be  subject  to  a  $30,000  price deduction. For the purposes of the set-aside units, dens are defined as being enclosed with a door, having a minimum of 70 square feet of floor area, being no less than seven feet in any horizontal dimension, and not housing any substantial mechanical equipment. (Housing)

## Discussion

Commissioner Manor confirmed that he spoke with the City Attorney Office to confirm that he does not have a conflict of interest in the project and was able to cast a vote.

Vice Chair McMahon noted that the project will bring something new to a building that currently does not offer many benefits to the community with minimal disruptions to the surrounding fabric. Vice Chair McMahon also noted how the site design will speak to the streetscape in a way that removes a surface parking lot and activates the space.  She expressed no concerns about the height increase and also acknowledged the importance of the affordable housing component of the project.

Commissioner Lyle agreed with the applicant's concerns about Condition 52, particularly with respect to not knowing the full cost of the bus shelter with conduit in the public right-of-way,

and asked the applicant to work with staff on a revision to the condition to identify an agreedupon cost and remove the requirement for electrical conduit to the bus shelter.

Commissioner Koenig noted that  the  project  is  creatively  and  pragmatically  transforming  a building that is outdated but still structurally sound and acknowledged that the transformation of the existing parking lot to an open space courtyard will be a great change. Commissioner Koenig expressed some concern about the number of projects coming forward with height limit increases but found it appropriate at this site.

Commissioner Brown noted that the Old Town North Small Area Plan has outdated language about office to residential conversions and expressed interest in an update to the plan that aligns with the current Citywide policy that encourages conversions.

Commissioner Ramirez expressed support in how the project will activate the area.

Chair Macek expressed support of the project based on the number of affordable units, the way the proposal will activate this portion of Old Town North, and that he was not concerned about the height increase based on the benefits provided and how the height does not exceed the height of the existing penthouse.

## Speakers

Andrea  Haslinger,  a  resident  of  Pitt  Street  Station  Townhouses,  spoke  in  opposition  of  the project as currently proposed based on the massing and height. Ms. Haslinger also expressed concerns about building access from North Saint Asaph Street extension and also noted that she did not receive any notice from the applicant.

Stephen Milone, representing Old Town Civic Association, spoke against the proposed height increase and suggested the project should explore wider streetscape improvements such as the landscape strip, and requested more EV chargers in the parking garage.

Ellen Mosher, Old Town resident, spoke in opposition of the project, expressing concerns about the height.

## I. SUMMARY

## A. Recommendation

Staff recommends approval of the request by PF III Abingdon, LLC ('the Applicant') for a Master Plan  Amendment,  Rezoning,  Development  Special  Use  Permit  with  Site  Plan,  and  associated applications to convert an existing commercial office building to residential multi-unit with the addition of a new wing to the building. This development provides a number of benefits for the city and the surrounding community, including:

- Replacement of an underutilized office building with a multi-unit building in a transit-rich location;
- New building with high-quality design and architectural character;
- Inclusion of seven (7) new affordable units on-site and a contribution of $181,568 to the Housing Trust Fund;
- Green  building and site design, including LEED  Silver  (or equivalent) building certification;
- Public art contribution (at a minimum value of $16,813);
- Monetary contributions of approximately $450,000 (2023$) to Old Town North Small Area Plan Implementation Fund;
- A $20,000 contribution to Capital Bikeshare; and
- Publicly accessible path at the southeast corner of the site.

The following issues are evaluated as part of the staff analysis:

- Conformance with the Master Plan and Other City Policies
- Site, Building Design and Board of Architectural Review
- Open Space, Pedestrian and Streetscape Improvements
- Parking and Transportation
- Stormwater Management
- Special Use Permits
- School Impacts
- Community Outreach

## B. General Project Description

The Applicant proposes to convert the existing office building into a 136-144 multi-unit residential building (including seven affordable units), with the construction of an additional building wing. Parking will consist of 162 total parking spaces. Of those, 138 parking spaces are located in the existing underground garage and 24 are existing surface parking spaces that are located to the rear of the site. The underground parking garage is one-level and accessed from the existing driveway on East Abingdon Drive along the northern perimeter of the building. The tallest portion of the building reaches six stories (65 feet) but is significantly setback. There will be an at-grade open

entry court with pedestrian access for building residents from East Abingdon Drive. There is a combination of ground level and above-grade open space, most of which is private for building residents.

The following approvals are requested:

- An amendment to the Old Town North Small Area Plan (OTNSAP) Chapter of the Master Plan to update to the Height Maps;
- A Map Amendment to amend the zoning from OCM(50) to CRMU-X; and
- A  Development  Special  Use  Permit  (DSUP)  with  Site  Plan  to  construct  a  multi-unit residential building, including:
- o A Special Use Permit to increase the maximum permitted floor area ratio to 2.5 in the CRMU-X zone.

## II. BACKGROUND

## A. Site Context

The five-story brick veneer office building at 1201 East Abingdon Drive was constructed in 19831984.  The  project  site  is  1.55  acres  (67,480  square  feet)  and  located  on  the  east  side  of  East Abingdon Drive, between Second Street and Bashford Lane. The site is also located in the Old and Historic Alexandria District and subject to the Washington Street Standards.

The site borders the Abingdon Row  Townhouse  development to the south, Riverton Condominiums to the north, East Abingdon Drive and the George Washington Memorial Parkway (GWMP) to the west, and the Canal Center and Pitt Street Station townhouses to the east. To the east of the site is a private street that is an extension of North Saint Asaph Street, providing access to  the  rear  parking  at  this  site  and  the  parking  associated  with  the  neighboring  townhouse developments. The topography of the site is generally flat, but slopes upward toward the east side of the building site.

## B. Detailed Project Description

East Abingdon Drive is a one-way northbound access road running approximately parallel to the George  Washington  Memorial  Parkway  (GWMP)  that  has  a  curve  reflective  of  the  former Memorial Circle. This area of the historic district along the GWMP reflects the more post-war suburban character and includes numerous garden apartment buildings and late 20 th -century office buildings.  The General Land Use Concept Plan (Subareas) in Figure 2.03 in the OTNSAP shows that the subject parcel is located within the boundaries of 'Subarea 2 - Predominantly Residential' in the OTNSAP but borders 'Subarea 1 - Washington Street Gateway' due to its location fronting the GWMP and former Memorial Circle (Figure 1).

Approximately 112,775 square feet of floor area of the existing office building will be converted to a residential multi-unit building, with the addition of an approximately 43,452-square foot new building wing at the south end of the property over the existing surface parking lot. A total of 136144  rental  units  will  be  included  with  the  proposal.  The  Preliminary  Plan  includes  136  units, however, the applicant has requested flexibility to adjust the number of units during the Final Site Plan process (up to 144). Of these, seven (7) units will be affordable. A total of 162 on-site parking spaces are proposed to serve the residents. There is an existing one-level, below-grade parking garage with 138 spaces accessed through the existing driveway at the northernmost portion of the site from East Abingdon Drive. The remaining 24 spaces are retained from the existing surface parking lot at the easternmost portion of the site. The surface parking spaces will be accessed from the private north-south street.

The proposed building addition at the southern end of the site will change the building from an 'L' shaped building into a 'U' shaped building. The existing building will have a new architectural expression and fenestration that will complement the addition. The ground level will be revised to feature additional glazing and street level entries. At the roof level, the general footprint of the existing penthouses will be expanded to allow for the introduction of additional occupiable space and units. The new wing at the south end of the site will be similar in size to the existing north wing but will have a slightly smaller footprint with a convex west wall meant to reflect the curve in  Abingdon  Drive  in  this  area.  The  red  brick  and  glass  addition  will  be  broken  into  vertical modules that are similar to historic townhomes.

The project will include approximately 19,000 square feet of open space: a private at-grade entry courtyard accessed from East Abingdon Drive, a private rooftop terrace, and a pathway at the southeast portion of the site with a public access easement. The building setbacks allow for a rooftop  amenity  terrace  on  the  sixth  floor  to  be  shared  by  all  residents.  Programming  of  the courtyard and rooftop amenity spaces will be determined during the final site plan process. The courtyard will also provide access to the main building entrance.

The  proposal  includes  a  variety  of  streetscape  improvements.  An  eight-food  wide  concrete sidewalk will be added to serve as a transition between the concrete sidewalk along East Abingdon Drive and the all-brick sidewalk at the adjacent Abingdon Row site. The addition of a layby on East Abingdon Drive will provide two (2) ride-share drop off and pickup spaces to serve as shortterm temporary parking for the site. There will be two landscape islands added to the surface

## IV. STAFF ANALYSIS

## A. Conformance to the City Master Plan

The site is included within the Old Town North Small Area Plan (OTNSAP), though it is not identified as a development site. The proposal requires an amendment to the OTNSAP through an update to the Recommended Height District Limits Map to allow for 65 feet in building height. Staff supports the Applicant's request for additional residential density and height on this site in order to create more diverse housing options in this transit-rich neighborhood and meet the goals and principles outlined in Tables 9 and 10 in the Appendix of this report, including:

- Establish land uses and building heights compatible with the neighborhood.
- o The change in use from office commercial to residential supports the site's location within the Predominantly Residential Subarea (Subarea 2) of the OTNSAP. The Plan  encourages  a  focus  on  residential  uses  within  this  subarea.  The  proposed height is compatible with nearby buildings.
- Enhance the design of the public realm in a way that prioritizes the pedestrian.
- o The public realm will be enhanced with new wider, concrete sidewalks, additional landscape strips, and Washington Street Lights. The applicant will also provide a publicly accessible pathway along the ground level open space which provides a pedestrian connection from East Abingdon Drive to the private road to the east.

## Master Plan Amendment

The  applicant  has  requested  a  Master  Plan  Amendment  to  the  Recommended  Height  District Limits map to increase the project height from 50 feet to no more than 65 feet. The Recommended Height District Limits for this site in the OTSNAP is 50 feet (Figure 2.14). The proposed building height at the tallest point is 65 feet. The portion of the building generally above 50 feet is the sixth story of the building which is significantly setback from the rest of the building footprint.

Staff notes that the current height of the building exceeds 50 feet as it was constructed prior to the Height District Map within the OTNSAP 4 . The proposed building height of 65 feet is consistent with the height of the existing building when measured to the top of the penthouses. However, the penthouses are not counted towards the overall height of the existing building as they only function

3 The applicant is requesting flexibility to add up to a total of 144 units in accordance with condition 9. The parking requirement will be recalculated during final site plan review if the units increase above 136.

4 Exclusive of the two (2) penthouses, the existing building height ranges from 51 feet 6 inches to 52 feet 6 inches. With the penthouses included, the building height ranges from 62 feet and 6 inches to 65 feet.

for  the  screening  of  mechanical  equipment  and  do  not  contain  habitable  space.  The  proposal includes the addition of habitable units on the sixth story of the building at the same height as the existing penthouses and thus must be included as part of the overall building height.

SECOND

Staff supports the applicant's request to amend the OTNSAP to increase the allowable building height to 65 feet, finding it consistent with the City's priority of increasing the overall housing supply, especially in transit-rich locations such as Old Town North. The proposed height increase also  contributes  toward  the  inclusion  of  seven  affordable  units.  Staff  also  finds  the  proposed building height compatible with adjacent buildings in this area, which includes garden apartment and office buildings, and notes that due to the significant setback of the portion of the building over 50 feet, the greater height is less perceptible.

## B. Rezoning

The applicant is requesting a rezoning to the CRMU-X (Commercial Residential Mixed Use - Old Town North) zone. The CRMU-X zone permits density up to 2.5 FAR with an SUP for residential uses. The existing OCM(50) zone permits limited redevelopment opportunities for residential or mixed use sites based on the permitted FAR for residential (1.5). The CRMU-X zone is intended to support multi-unit and mixed use developments within the Old Town North neighborhood. The scale and density of the proposed project is consistent with other nearby multi-unit and mixed use developments which were recently approved, including 901 North Pitt Street and the Tidelock redevelopment, both approved in 2022.

Staff recommends this rezoning for a number of reasons: 1) the proposal is consistent with the principles of the OTNSAP outlined above and is consistent with the City's Housing Master Plan and Regional Housing Goals; 2) the project meets the OTNSAP vision to provide a variety of housing choices and building types that are affordable and accessible to a diverse range of ages,

incomes,  abilities,  and  household  sizes;  3)  the  increased  density  associated  with  the  rezoning results  in  the  creation  of  seven  (7)  affordable  units;  and,  4)  the  project  provides  quality  urban design and enhances the existing streetscapes around the site.

## Criteria for Rezoning without a Master Plan Study

While staff supports the rezoning request, the rezoning proposal should be reviewed against the criteria for the rezoning of a property outside of a small area planning process, since the site was not identified as a redevelopment site in the plan and thus a rezoning was not recommended in the OTNSAP. The criteria (adopted by  City Council  in  December  2010)  are  listed  and  explained below, with staff response located below each criterium:

SMALL AREA PLAN: Is the proposal consistent with the small area plan for the area, or is a master plan amendment required? Is the proposal consistent with the intent of the master plan for the area, even if the zoning needs adjustment? Will the proposal be inconsistent with or a radical departure from the other existing uses in the area? If there is no master plan amendment required, then it is typical for the rezoning to proceed on its own.

Staff Response: A master plan amendment is required to allow the proposed building height of 65 feet, however the proposed multi-unit development is consistent with the uses and scale in the immediate vicinity, which are multi-unit, townhouse, and other commercial  developments.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  goals  and  objectives  of Subarea 2, which is predominantly residential.

TYPE OF AREA: Is the area one where redevelopment is encouraged or one that is slated for revitalization, such as Arlandria and West Eisenhower? Would the proposal be inconsistent with or a radical departure from the other existing uses in the area? For example, a proposal for a high rise in the middle of single-family homes would not be consistent with the City's policy to protect residential  areas.  The  need  to  protect  residential  neighborhoods  would  weigh  in  favor  of  not proceeding without a thorough study and, if necessary, an area wide rezoning plan.

Staff Response: The site is located within the boundary of the OTNSAP, which was updated in 2017 with the anticipation that significant redevelopment would occur in the neighborhood. The proposed conversion is consistent with the residential nature of the surrounding vicinity.

ISOLATED PARCEL(S): If the property if one of several within the immediate area, all of which holding the potential for redevelopment with foreseeable impacts on traffic, public benefits, the street network or other amenities which suggest the benefit of further study, then a small area plan review may be warranted. The need for further and broader study will impact the consideration of a rezoning application. If a study is necessary for the subject property as well as others, then that fact weighs in favor of the application not proceeding.

Staff Response: The OTNSAP identified several sites in the area with a potential for redevelopment in the near and mid-term future and included analysis related to impacts

on  traffic,  public  benefits  and  the  like.  Staff  does  not  think  that  broader  study  is warranted given the scale of this office conversion project.

STATUS OF PLANNING FOR AREA: Is there a small area plan or other planning study slated to begin within the next fiscal year, or in progress? If a study is underway or about to be, then the rezoning  should  not  proceed  until  guidelines  for  appropriate  development  are  understood  as  a result of the planning work. If a study is not formally scheduled for the area, then that fact weighs in favor of the application proceeding without a study.

Staff Response: The OTNSAP was updated in 2017, with many elements of the plan still being implemented. There is no future plan to update the OTNSAP.

APPLICATION'S CONSISTENCY WITH CITY GOALS: Is the parcel well served by mass transit? Is expanded high capacity transit service anticipated in the near term in the area? Could development  of  the  parcel  contribute  to  the  viability  or  implementation  of  already  planned expansion of transit services? Does the proposal comply with all city policies other than the land use called for in the Master Plan? Does it, for example, reflect the direction, policy and goals of the  City  for  its  future  transportation,  environment,  and  housing  and  for  protecting  existing residential neighborhoods? If Council has made land use decisions for the area, it is consistent with them? If the parcel meets the City's goals for an area, that weighs in favor of the application proceeding without a study.

Staff  Response: The impact of the project is  projected  to  be  minimal.  The  proposed residential use would actually generate less traffic than an occupied office building and would not demand additional mass transit facilities. The site is served by the WMATA line 11Y bus and is located within a block from the DASH line 34 bus. Additionally, the project removes a prominent surface parking lot and helps to meet the City's Regional Housing Goals with the addition of 136 units in an underutilized office building.

## C. Compliance with City Policies

## Green Building Policy

The project at 1201 East Abingdon Drive will meet the 2019 Green Building Policy. The Applicant is  still  evaluating  which  certification  option  (LEED,  Green  Globes,  Earthcraft,  or  NGBS)  and associated potential points the project will pursue.

The proposed residential building is an adaptive reuse of a steel, concrete, and masonry office building. The adaptive reuse of the existing underground garage structure and office building will significantly reduce the embodied carbon footprint, cost, and construction duration of the overall project.

Building envelope attributes for the project will include:

1. Exterior insulated double pane windows, with Low-E glass, and storefront frames that have a 'thermal break'.

2. Insulated Grade 1 exterior walls systems with R21 insulation.
3. Insulated roofing systems with minimum R38 insulation.

The  dwelling  units  and  their  kitchens  and  bathrooms  are  stacked  to  limit  the  unnecessary distribution of additional plumbing, hot water, and exhaust systems. This contributes to embodied carbon and energy usage over the life of the building. To additionally lower the project's energy usage, timers and photovoltaic sensors will be used to control some of the building's exterior lighting.

Dwelling units will include EnergyStar appliances and energy-efficient, properly sized HVAC systems.

Stormwater will be captured from the roof and used to irrigate landscaped planters filled with drought  tolerant  and  native  plantings.  The  sixth-floor  terrace  will  have  green  roofing  for stormwater mitigation and at least two percent of the project's parking spaces will have active electric vehicle chargers.

## Public Art Policy

In December 2014, the City Council adopted the Public Art Policy which established a monetary contribution requirement for development projects to go towards public art. The contribution can be used for public art on the site or a monetary contribution to further the City's public arts efforts in  the  neighborhood.  Should  on-site  art  not  be  provided,  then  a  contribution  amount  of approximately $16,813, or $0.30 per gross square foot of development, is recommended.

## Affordable Housing Policy

Consistent with the Commercial to Residential Conversion component of the 2023 Zoning for Housing initiative, the project proposes to convert a non-competitive office building to residential use to expand housing options in close proximity to jobs, services, and amenities. The project's affordable housing contribution consists of three parts.

Consistent with the City's 2020/21 Housing Contribution Policy Update (Policy), which requires ten percent of residential floor area above what is recommended in the underlying small area plan be  provided  as  affordable  housing,  the  applicant  will  provide  two  committed  affordable  units (CAUs). (The project is in Old Town North which is defined in the Policy as a core submarket.)

Due to its location within Height District 1, which has a 50-foot height limit, the project is unable to request bonus height through Section 7-700; the project is pursuing additional height through a Master Plan Amendment (MPA). The applicant has proposed to provide additional CAUs. This contribution is equivalent to the contribution that would have been required had the project been able to utilize bonus height. In total, the project will provide seven CAUs.

The  CAUs  comprise  one  (1)  one-bedroom,  four  (4)  one-bedroom  and  den,  and  two  (2)  twobedroom units. This unit mix is generally proportional to the project's planned unit mix for a 136 multi-unit building (Table 4). Should the project's total unit count and mix change at the time of Final Site Plan (potentially up to 144 units), the applicant will provide seven CAUs with a unit mix  substantially  equivalent  to  the  unit  mix  presented  by  staff  to  the  Alexandria  Housing Affordability Advisory Committee (AHAAC) at their December 7, 2023 meeting.

Table 4

| Unit Type         |   Units | Unit Mix as %of Total Units   |   Affordable Units | Affordable Unit Mix as % of Total Affordable Units   |
|-------------------|---------|-------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|

| One-bedroom       |      28 | 21%                           |                  1 | 14%                                                  |
| One-bedroom + den |      72 | 53%                           |                  4 | 57%                                                  |
| Two-bedroom       |      29 | 21%                           |                  2 | 29%                                                  |
|                   |     136 |                               |                  7 |                                                      |

Rents (adjusted for utilities and parking fees) will be affordable to households with incomes at 60% of the Area Median Income (AMI) (equivalent to $63,300-$90,420 in 2023 for a household with one to four members, respectively), as well as to eligible households with Housing Choice (Section 8) vouchers as required by State law. In addition, 'non-standard' unit types such as onebedroom + den units must have rent limits equal to their closest equivalent; one-bedroom + den units will rent at a one-bedroom rate. The units will remain affordable for a 40-year period from the date of initial occupancy. The residents of CAUs will have the same access to amenities as do market-rate residents in the project.

If the project converts from a rental to a for-sale condominium structure or is constructed as such, the applicant will provide seven for-sale CAUs. The final CAU mix will be evaluated at the time of Final Site Plan for proportionality. For-sale units will be affordable to households with incomes generally ranging between 70% and 100% AMI (Table 5). City homeownership assistance will be available  to  eligible  households  to  help  with  down  payment  and  closing  costs.  The  units  will remain affordable with equity sharing enforced through deeds of covenant restricting their resale.

The starting point for the prices of the affordable for-sale units is the City's standard prices, which include  one  parking  space:  $225,000  for  a  one-bedroom  and  $275,000  for  a  two-bedroom. Consistent with the City's policy which requires the unbundling of housing from parking, buyers of the affordable units will have the opportunity to purchase up to one parking space per household for $30,000; if the buyer does not purchase a parking space, the unit will be discounted $30,000 from the standard price. In addition, units with dens are priced $25,000 above the standard price

due to the added value created by the additional space (Table 6). For the purposes of CAUs, dens are defined as being enclosed with a door, having a minimum of 70 square feet of floor area, being no less than seven feet in any horizontal dimension, and not housing any substantial mechanical equipment.

Table 6

| 2023 Affordable For-Sale Prices   | 2023 Affordable For-Sale Prices   | 2023 Affordable For-Sale Prices   |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Unit Type                         | Price (w/ parking space)          | Price (w/o parking space)         |
| One-Bedroom                       | $225,000                          | $195,000                          |
| One-Bedroom Plus Den              | $250,000                          | $220,000                          |
| Two-Bedroom                       | $275,000                          | $245,000                          |

Consistent  with  the  City's  Procedures  Regarding  Affordable  Housing  Contributions,  the application is subject to the contribution rate in effect at the time the application's concept plan was accepted for review (2022). The applicant will provide a voluntary monetary contribution of $181,568 to the Housing Trust Fund based on the floor area associated with the office to residential conversion.  Should  the  project  proceed  as  for-sale  condominiums,  it  is  anticipated  that  the contribution would help fund part of the City's downpayment and closing cost assistance needed for the project's future CAU purchasers.

Staff's memo and the applicant's Affordable Housing Plan dated October 20, 2023 were presented to AHAAC on December 7, 2023. Members discussed aspects of the site plan including parking and  drop-off  points.  The  Committee  voted  to  unanimously  endorse  the  affordable  housing contribution.

## D. Site, Building Design and Board of Architectural Review (BAR)

The addition of a multi-unit building in this portion of Old Town North near existing residential townhouses, condominiums, a hotel, and office buildings provides a unique opportunity to convert an outdated office building to a residential use and blend into the surrounding neighborhood fabric. The Old Town North neighborhood contains a variety of uses and architectural styles, ranging from Colonial Revival era townhomes to 1970s era concrete and brick residential towers and 1980s era office buildings and existing mixed-use projects. Staff is supportive of the vision of a simple, well-designed architectural approach and worked with the applicant to ensure that the building would  not  read  as  an  office  building.  Balconies  will  be  added  to  several  units  to  support  a residential scale rhythm and a prominent entry courtyard defines the entrance and residential use. In design discussions, the design approach was to create a building with two defined sections in a U-shape form.  The new building wing was designed to enhance the entry courtyard and overall built environment of the site, creating a strong street presence in the place of a surface parking lot The exterior brick of the existing building will be generally reused (with new windows and a change in fenestration) and the new building wing design includes gray brick masonry. The setback sixth floor is comprised of metal panels on both building wings.

The applicant will also implement site improvements to the property that will transform the site from an underutilized office building to an activated multi-unit residential building, such as the entry courtyard, wider sidewalks which provide pedestrian connectivity to the surrounding area,

and landscaping, including street trees. The proposed site and building design illustrate how an outdated office building can be converted and modified to activate the space.

The BAR reviewed the project in concept on July 6, 2023 (BAR Case #2023-00245). At concept review, the BAR provided extensive feedback in accordance with the Concept Review Policy, which outlines the optional, informal review whereby the BAR provides the applicant, staff, and the Planning Commission and City Council with comments relating to the overall appropriateness of a project's height, scale, mass and general architectural character. Concept reviews also include an  opportunity  for  public  comment.  Specifically,  the  proposed  project  was  evaluated  for  its compliance with the Washington Street Standards. When reviewing designs for new construction the Design  Guidelines state  that  'As  a  general  rule,  the  Board  favors  contextual  background buildings which allow historic structures to maintain the primary visual importance.  Singular buildings in the latest architectural vocabulary are generally discouraged. It is not the intention of the Board to dilute design creativity in residential buildings. Rather the Board seeks to promote compatible development that is, at once, both responsive to the (current) needs and tastes while being compatible with the historic character of the districts. This balancing act will clearly be different in different sections of the historic districts.'

When the applicant first approached BAR and City staff, the design of the building still included a variety of features that read as an office building. Staff encouraged the applicant to incorporate features to provide more of a multi-unit residential rhythm, such as the addition of balconies on some units,  the  ground-level  courtyard  at  the  building  entrance,  and  metal  canopies  placed  to complement the windows.

Following approval of the DSUP by City Council, the applicant will return to the BAR for approval of a Certificate of Appropriateness for the multi-unit building and will refine design details and material selections.

## E. Open Space, Pedestrian and Streetscape Improvements

## Open Space

Table 7 - Open Space

| OPEN SPACE                                          | AMOUNT                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Required per CRMU-X Zone                            | 16,185 SF (25% of site area)   |
| Total Provided                                      | 19,000 SF (29.3% of site area) |
| At-grade private entrance courtyard and public path | 12,000 SF (18.5% of provided)  |
| Above-grade rooftop (private)                       | 7,000 SF (10.8% of provided)   |

Staff supports the proposed open space, which includes a variety of private and publicly accessible open space areas as noted in Table 7 above, as well as the removal of a large surface parking lot. The project exceeds the 25 percent open and usable space requirement by about four percent. The portion of at-grade open space at the southeast corner of the site will be publicly accessible with a pathway connecting pedestrians to a sidewalk constructed as part of the Abingdon Row project

along the private North Saint Asaph Street extension at the rear of the building. At the Final Site Plan  stage,  the  applicant  will  provide  details  about  the  rooftop  amenities,  including  shade structures, grills, and seating.

## Pedestrian and Streetscape Improvements

The  existing  office  building  and  surface  parking  lot  make  for  an  unattractive  streetscape  and pedestrian experience and the proposed streetscape improvements, which include new sidewalks, area for right-of-way dedication, a pickup and drop-off layby, and a landscape strip along the building perimeter will help knit this site more seamlessly into the urban fabric. The applicant will incorporate new Washington Street Lights along East Abingdon Drive in addition to new concrete sidewalks.  A  portion  of  the  sidewalk  will  be  an  easement  for  public  access  and  utilities.  An additional 2,758 square feet of area along East Abingdon Drive will be dedicated right-of-way.

A layby will be added on the east side of East Abingdon Drive in front of the building to provide two temporary spaces for rideshare drop-off and pickup and other temporary deliveries. In addition to the landscape strip, two landscape islands will be provided at the rear of the building adjacent to the surface parking spaces. Following the completion of the proposed project, the portion of East Abingdon Drive that fronts the site will see significantly more pedestrian activity and a safer, more attractive streetscape.

## F. Stormwater Management

This  project  will  ensure  compliance  with  all  stormwater  requirements  of  Chapter  XIII  of  the Zoning Ordinance by using a green roof and a hydrodynamic separator device that will treat the site's entire disturbed area, including portions of the existing building that are outside the limits of disturbance. Compliance with the City's 65% green infrastructure requirements is met through the green roof area providing 70% of the project's necessary phosphorus reduction, with the remaining required phosphorus reduction provided through the hydrodynamic separator device. The green roof will extend onto portions of the existing building, achieving additional stormwater quality treatment by removing 0.39lbs of phosphorous per year, which significantly exceeds the project's necessary  required  reduction  of  .10lbs  per  year.  Currently,  there  is  an  existing  stormwater detention vault under the parking lot that conveys the entire building's stormwater runoff and will remain after the project is completed.

## G. Parking and Transportation

The proposed project will utilize the existing below-grade parking garage and the existing surface parking spaces at the eastern side of the site for all of its parking, allowing the removal of the existing surface lot fronting the GWMP. The parking garage is accessed from East Abingdon Drive at the far north end of the parcel with the downward sloping ramp along the east side of the building. The loading space is located along the driveway at the north end of the site and will serve as the location for the site's private trash collection.

## Traffic Impacts

The applicant has completed transportation, traffic and parking studies, including:

- Multimodal Transportation Network Assessment;
- Public Transit Services, Nearby Bicycle Network, &amp; Pedestrian Access;
- On-Street Parking Restrictions; and
- Trip Generation.

These studies were used to determine the required amount of on-site parking spaces and identify how much on-street parking is available in the neighborhood. As a result, the project does not qualify to allow Residential Parking Permits (RPPs) to be issued for the residents of the building, as specified in Condition 142c.

According to the City's guidelines for the trip generation for a proposed development, the proposal does not trigger a traffic study. The proposed project being a residential use will actually generate fewer trips than would occur at an occupied office building.

According to the trip generation analysis submitted by the applicant, the proposed development is expected to generate approximately 128 fewer weekday trips in the morning peak hour, and 121 fewer trips in the evening peak hour than the existing office development. Furthermore, the Trip Generation Report also shows 89 fewer morning peak hour weekday trips and 85 fewer evening peak hour weekday trips assuming a 30% non-auto reduction.

## Transit and Bicycle Facilities

The site is well-served by a robust variety of transit options, including the Braddock Metro Station, DASH bus stops for the 34, 31, and 30, and a Metrobus stop for the 11Y which is located on East Abingdon Drive immediately to the south of the site. DASH lines 30 and 31 serve both the King Street/Old Town and Braddock Metro stations, while DASH line 34 and Metrobus line 11Y serve the new Potomac Yard Metro Station. The site is near two Capital Bikeshare stations, with the closest located to the west at the intersection of Powhatan Street and Bashford Lane. Another Capital Bikeshare station is located at the intersection of North Pitt and Montgomery streets. Staff has conditioned the Applicant to provide a $20,000 contribution to the City's Capital Bikeshare fund for enhancements to Bikeshare facilities within the plan area.

## Transportation Management Plan

The  applicant  is  required  to  contribute  to  the  City-wide  Transportation  Management  Plan  in accordance with Section 11-700 of the Zoning Ordinance and Conditions 48 through 53.

## H. Special Use Permits

Section 11-500 of the Zoning Ordinance gives authority to the City Council to approve Special Use Permits (SUPs), one of which is included with this application. The Zoning Ordinance requires that the approval of the SUPs associated with the development application:

.

1. Will  not  adversely  affect  the  health  or  safety  of  persons  residing  or  working  in  the neighborhood of the proposed use;
2. Will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood; and
3. Will substantially conform to the master plan of the city.

A summary of the SUP requested with this application along with a rationale for approval is provided below.

## Increase in Residential FAR to 2.5 in the CRMU-X Zone

The Applicant has requested an increase in FAR (floor area ratio) up to 2.5 in the CRMU-X zone to allow for a multi-unit development on a small urban site. Staff supports the request for increased density, as it allows the Applicant to provide a multi-unit building with seven affordable units with a height and massing that is compatible with the Washington Street Guidelines in this area of the Old and Historic District and is consistent with the principles of the OTNSAP in this transit-rich area of the city.

Based on the three criteria City Council considers in its approval of SUPs, staff supports this approval due to the following:

1. The increased density will not have an adverse effect on area residents and workers, as the building's  massing,  height,  and  scale  is  compatible  with  other  recently  approved developments within the OTNSAP boundary with a similar contemporary building design.
2. The project will mitigate potential impacts by providing sufficient open space, belowgrade parking, and streetscape improvements, such as new concrete sidewalks and a layby for drop-off and pickup.
3. This project contributes to meeting the goals and objectives highlighted in the OTNSAP as discussed in Section A of this report and supports other City-wide goals such as the Regional Housing Goals. Furthermore, the project demonstrates support with the City's recent recognition as a national leader in office to residential conversions.

## I. School Impacts

The applicant proposes to construct 136 multifamily units and the student generation rate for new market-rate mid-rise multifamily units is 0.04 students per market-rate unit and 0.90 per affordable units.  Staff  estimates  the  proposed  development  will  generate  approximately  twelve  (12)  new students. This project is located within the Jefferson-Houston K-8, George Washington Middle School,  and  Alexandria  City  High  School  attendance  areas.  Students  will  have  the  option  of attending either Jefferson-Houston or George Washington for middle school. Staff will integrate the proposed development project in forthcoming school enrollment forecasts.

## V. COMMUNITY

The applicant hosted three in-person community meetings on the subject site which were all wellattended and one in-person meeting with the Towns of Abingdon Homeowners Association. The project was well-received by the community, with questions raised about parking and anticipated pedestrian usage of the private drive aisle at the east side of the site (North Saint Asaph Street extension). The site falls within the boundary of the North Old Town Civic Association (NOTICe) and the applicant reached out to them to discuss the project. Additionally, the applicant presented to the BAR one time. Finally, the applicant installed a sign at the site in January 2024 with project details and contact information.

[Parking Garage Recommendations]

Gate off the section of the underground garage dedicated to residents from the retail section. Control access by electronic means. This design helps prevent tampering with resident's vehicles and other crimes.

Provide controlled access for doors in the garage (garage levels only) that lead to the stairwell. Controlled access must not interfere with the emergency push-bar release located on the inside of the stairwell.

## [Landscape Recommendations]

Plant shrubbery that achieves a natural growth height of no more than 2.5 to 3 feet with a maximum height of 3 feet when it matures to avoid obstructing the view of patrolling law enforcement officers.

[Open Space]

Choose benches middle armrests to deter unwanted sleeping and skateboarding.

## [Miscellaneous]

Equip all ground floor windows with a device or hardware that enables securing them in a partially open position. This design prevents breaking and entering when the windows are open for air.

Install 'door-viewers' (commonly known as a peepholes) in all doors on the ground level that lead directly into an apartment to increase security for the occupant.

Table 9 - OTNSAP Plan Principles

| Elevate the importance of design excellence through design standards and guidelines.               | The project is located on the George Washington Memorial Parkway and thus is required to meet the Washington Street Standards reviewed by the Board of Architectural Review (BAR). Furthermore, all sites located in the Old and Historic District demonstrate strong design principles with high-quality materials.   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Achieve a balanced mix of residents and employees.                                                 | The new building will house only residents with a small number of building management and leasing employees.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Focus retail in concentrated areas.                                                                | Not applicable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Establish land uses and building heights compatible with the neighborhood.                         | The change in use from office commercial to residential supports the site's location within the Predominantly Residential Subarea (Subarea 2) of the OTNSAP. The Plan encourages a focus on residential uses within this subarea. The proposed height is compatible with nearby buildings.                             |
| Encourage arts and cultural uses.                                                                  | Not applicable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Enhance the design of the public realm in a way that prioritizes the pedestrian.                   | The public realm will be enhanced with new wider, concrete sidewalks, additional landscape strips, and Washington Street Lights. The applicant will also provide publicly-accessible open space.                                                                                                                       |
| Create a mix of uses with transit options offering a lifestyle that is independent of automobiles. | The site is in a highly walkable and bikeable location. The project is well served by buses. There are nearby Capital Bikeshare stations and bike racks are included as part of the proposal.                                                                                                                          |
| Provide a range of housing opportunities for a diverse population.                                 | The proposed conversion and building addition will provide 136 new residential units. Of these, seven (7) will be affordable.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Create a variety of passive and active open spaces.                                                | The plan provides private open space for residents in several locations and publicly accessible passive open                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Utilize sustainability measures based on the priorities of water quality, stormwater, green infrastructure, energy and green building. | The project is compliant with the City's 2019 Green Building Policy and integrates green infrastructure in the form of green roof areas, bioretention landscape planters, and other stormwater BMPs. |
| Incorporate the history of the plan area into future redevelopment sites, parks and open spaces.                                       | The project will integrate the site's history through the inclusion of historic interpretation elements, such as signage or interpretive panels.                                                     |

## JUSTIFICATION FOR AMENDMENT

(attach separate sheets if needed)

1. Explain how and why any proposed amendment(s) to the Master Plan are desirable, beneficial to surrounding properties, in character with the applicable Small Area Plan and consistent with City policies:

*

2. Explain how and why the proposed amendment to the Zoning Map(s) is consistent with the proposed amendment to the Master Plan, or, if no amendment to the Master Plan is being requested, how the proposed zoning map amendment is consistent with the existing Master Plan:

OTN SAP recommends rezonings to the OTN specific district of CRMU-X.  While the property was not designated for redevelopment or rezoning, residential use is consistent with the general character and Sub Area recommendations for the Property.

3. Explain how the property proposed for reclassification will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services such as highways, streets, parking spaces, police and fire, drainage structures, refuse disposal, water and sewers, and schools.

The surrounding streets will operate at a less congested state with residential use as compared to office use.  All storm water management will be significantly upgraded with the redevelopment of the property.  No new parking will be constructed as the existing parking is sufficient for the proposed number of residential units.

4. If this application is for conditional zoning approval pursuant to Section  11-804 of the Zoning Ordinance, identify all proffered conditions that are to be considered part of this application (see Zoning Ordinance Section 11-804 for restrictions on conditional zoning):

1201 E. Abingdon Drive Master Plan Amendment Statement of Support October 20, 2023

The Applicant, PF III Abingdon LLC, an affiliate of The Pinkard Group, seeks Master Plan Amendments for the property 1201 E. Abingdon Drive (the 'Property') to allow for the conversion of an existing office building to a multifamily residential building.  The Property is subject to the Old Town North Small Area Plan (OTN SAP); however, is not designated as a development site (Figure 2.07, p.35).  The OTN SAP does acknowledge that 'other sites not identified in the plan area may redevelop . . . [and] will be subject to all necessary City approvals (p.34).'   Despite this designation, the Applicant believes that the conversion of a 1980s office building with a high vacancy rate to new housing, including on-site affordable housing, is consistent with the Housing goals of the OTN SAP (p.57-60) by providing a significant benefit to the City amidst a regional housing shortage. Additionally, residential use at the Property is consistent with the General Land Use Concept shown in the applicable Sub-Area on p. 15.

Specifically, the Applicant seeks the following Master Plan Amendments concurrently with a Rezoning to the CRMU-X District and a Development Special Use Permit (DSUP).

1. Designation of the Property as a site for rezoning to the CRMU-X (p.40); and
2. Increase in building height to 65' to allow for the residential use of the existing mechanical penthouse level (p.43).
- a. Note the proposed height is in line with OTN SAP broad statement 'that the predominant building heights in the plan area be mid-rise (50-77 feet) punctuated by taller buildings at strategic locations' (p.41).

In support of the Master Plan Amendments, the development provides the following benefits that would not otherwise be provided with a previously contemplated by right conversion:

1. Expansion of housing and an increase from zero (0) to seven (7) on-site affordable housing units, where five (5) affordable housing units are required per the City's 2020 Affordable Housing Policy;

2. Narrative description. The applicant shall describe below the nature of the request in detail so that the Planning Commission and City Council can understand the nature of the operation and the use, including such items as the nature of the activity, the number and type of patrons, the number of employees, the hours, how parking is to be provided for employees and patrons, and whether the use will generate any noise.  If not appropriate to the request, delete pages 6-9.  (Attach additional sheets if necessary.)

The Applicant proposes an office-to-residential conversion.  The existing brick building on the Property was originally built in the 1980s.  There is a surface parking lot and underground parking.  Due to the on-going, diminished office market and current high vacancy rate, the Applicant seeks residential use to repurpose the building.  In addition to introducing residential units at the penthouse level, the Applicant seeks to add a building wing at the south of the property on the existing surface parking lot. Other changes include the installation of residential window, lobby improvements, ground level amenity courtyard, and other building and site features consistent with residential use. To further its proposal, the Applicant seeks a rezoning to the CRMU-X zoning District, consistent with the applicable Old Town North Small Area Plan (OTN SAP).   The Applicant also requests a MPA for an increase above the 50' height limit, as the existing mechanical penthouse will be converted to residential units.  An SUP is requested to allow for 1) residential use in the CRMU-X; and 2) for up to a 2.5 FAR; . The Applicant attended a BAR Concept work session and has incorporated BAR comments into the enclosed design.Amidst a regional and city wide need for housing, the repurposing of an outdated office building with residential use, including affordable housing, in the OTN SAP area is a significant benefit to the City.

Revised: 5/11/2020 - AEF

1201 E. Abingdon Drive CDSP #2022-00026 Affordable Housing Plan Octobe 20, 2023

PF III Abingdon, LLC (the 'Applicant'), an affiliate of The Pinkard Group  proposes a Development Special Use Permit ('DSUP') for the residential conversion of the existing office building on the property known as 1201 E. Abingdon Drive (the 'Property').  The Property is bordered to the west by E. Abingdon Drive and the George Washington Memorial Parkway; the Riverton Condominium to the north; and the recently developed Towns of Abingdon to the south.  East of the building, there is a row of surface parking for the Property, N. St. Asaph Street and a surface parking lot for the Pitt Street Office Centre building.  The Property sits on a site of approximately 67,480 SF or 1.55 acres.  The future development of the Property is guided by the Old Town North Small Area Plan ('OTN SAP').

The Applicant proposes a building conversion that includes a total of 156,227 SF of Floor Area.  A total of 136 residential units is proposed.  The proposed residential units are planned to be rental, with seven (7) studios (5 %), twenty-eight (28) one-bedrooms (21%), seventy-two (72) one-bedrooms with dens (53%), and twenty-nine (29) two-bedrooms (21%).  The Applicant proposes a rezoning to the CRMU-X zone, a DSUP and a master plan amendment to allow for occupiable penthouse over 50', to a height of approximately 65'.

The Applicant is able to convert 112,775 SF of Floor Area of the existing building to residential use by right.  The Applicant proposes to add Additional Density of 43,452 SF including the penthouse level.  Under the applicable, existing 2020 City Affordable Housing policy, residential developments in a core market that exceed the recommended density in the applicable small area plan (SAP), are required to provide 10% of the increase in residential development as affordable housing.  Here, the Additional Density of 43,452 SF is density in excess of the Old Town North SAP and therefore 10% or 4.3 units rounding to five (5) units is the required affordable housing contribution under the applicable City policy.

The Applicant recognizes the great need for affordable housing and proposes seven (7) units affordable housing.  This contribution is 63% greater than the amount of affordable housing required pursuant to the City policy detailed above.  The Applicant agrees to provide a mix of affordable unit types proportionate to the market rate unit types.

In addition to the proposed on-site affordable housing, the Applicant agrees to pay to the voluntary affordable housing contribution applied to 112,775 SF of converted, existing density. At the 2022 rate of $1.61/SF, the voluntary contribution totals $181,568.

The Applicant's affordable housing proposal exceeds the current City policy and the Zoning Ordinance.  This high-quality development will add more than anticipated affordable housing to an area of the City where more affordable housing is needed.  Additionally, the project adds housing consistent with Metro-DC regional goals of increasing housing to meet unmet needs.

## Green Building Narrative:

The proposed residential building is an adaptive reuse of a steel and concrete and masonry office building. We have currently drafted a preliminary LEED scorecard for this project (sheet A006); we are still determining the best sustainability criteria (LEED, Earthcraft, NGBS, etc) and potential points to pursue.

The adaptive reuse of the existing underground garage structure and office building will significantly reduce the embodied carbon footprint ,cost and construction duration of the overall project.

Massing and Orientation items for the project include:

1. The dwelling units and their kitchen and bathrooms are stacked to limit the unnecessary distribution of additional plumbing, hot water, and exhaust systems, that contribute to lowering power usage.

Building envelope attributes for the project include:

1. Exterior insulated double pane windows, with Low-E glass, and storefront frames that have a 'thermal break'.
2. Insulated Grade 1 exterior walls systems with R21 insulation.
3. Insulated roofing systems with minimum R38 insulation.
4. An efficient building envelope will allow the mechanical systems to be sized smaller, also contributing to the reduction of power usage.
5. Green and low albedo roofing on 6 th  floor terrace and roof to reduce solar heat gain.

## Exterior and interior lighting attributes include:

1. Timers and photovoltaic sensors to control some building exterior lighting so they do not stay on all night.

Electrical management for plug and process of loads include:

1. Dwelling units will include Energy Star Appliances.

Mechanical systems for the project will include:

1. Energy efficient HVAC system sized per ACCA Manual J and selected using ACCA Manual s.
2. Thermostats would be programmed as a specific temperature range.

## Water considerations will include:

1. Drought tolerant/native landscaping plants.
2. Reuse rainwater from roof drainage into landscape planters.

3. Low flow WaterSense plumbing fixtures (toilet, faucet, showerhead).
4. Rain sensor shutoff for an irrigation installed.
5. Green roofing on the 6 th  floor terrace and roof for storm water mitigation.

## Indoor Environmental Quality:

1. Protecting all ducts until floor/wall finishing is complete.
2. easily accessible filters for property maintenance service
3. All indoor paints &lt;100g/L VOC content.

1. Construction shall be compatible with and similar to the traditional building character, mass, scale, design and style [of buildings] found on Wash. St. [that have] historic architectural merit.
- a. There appears to be no nearby buildings of historic architectural merit nearby the Property.
- b. Surrounding buildings appear built between 1980s and today and are mostly 4story residential town houses with exception of 1220 N. Pitt St. office building (34 stories).   There appears to be historic garden apartments fronting Bashford Lane, north of the Property (Riverton Condos and Potomac Shores).
- c. Nearby recent developments distinct from 1980-1990s brick town homes include the Gables project, The Muse, The Venue.
2. Elements of design consistent with historic buildings which are found on the street shall be emphasized.
- a. 4-story townhouses are nearby.  Bays are replicated through façade demarcation on south façade.  Penthouse is stepped back from south façade, receding from four-story element.
- b. The expansion of the existing north wing and south wing establish an urban edge along East Abingdon, consistent with historic Old Town and new developments in the vicinity (The Gables, The Muse, The Venue).
- c. These two wings will form a semi/public fenced urban park, activated by residential stoops, and the residents' lobby.
3. New buildings and additions to existing buildings shall not by their style, size, location or other characteristic detract from, overwhelm, or otherwise intrude upon historic buildings which are found on the street.
- a. Style at new portions of building responds/complements the 4-story massing and bays that surround the property.  Materials (brick) are consistent with brick townhouses surrounding the Property.  Materials are consistent with other new nearby development such as the Gables project, The Muse, The Venue.
4. The design of new buildings and additions to existing buildings shall be complementary to historic buildings which are found on the street.
- a. There are no historic buildings nearby the Property.
- b. Design of additions to the existing building is broken up into five-story bay delineations.
5. The massing of new buildings or additions to existing buildings adjacent to historic buildings which are found on the street shall closely reflect and be proportional to the massing of the adjacent historic buildings.
- a. There are no historic buildings nearby the Property.

- b. Style at new portions of building complements the 4 brick story bays that surround it.  Penthouse is now setback at south façade.
6. New buildings and additions larger than historic buildings shall be designed to look separate and shall not give the impression of being more massive than historic buildings.  This design objective shall be accomplished through differing historic architectural designs, facades, setbacks, roof lines and styles.  Buildings should appear from the right of way to have a footprint no larger than 100 feet by 80 feet.
- a. Different designs and styles accomplished through distinct modern materials and design consistent with  the Gables project, The Muse, The Venue.  Rooflines will differ since flat roof is proposed.  Penthouse will be setback receding the mass into the background. The selection of dark color metal paneling at the penthouse level further helps visually recede the penthouse from the masonry building below.
- b. The new addition footprint is approximately 110' X 86', which is substantially consistent with 100' X 80'.
- c. The new addition massing will be clearly separated from the existing building with deep recessed glass hyphens and a contrasting oyster gray and charcoal color brick expression. These hyphens will be visible from the South elevation and internal courtyard.
- d. The new addition oyster gray light brick is intended for contrast with the existing retrofitted building. The light brick color was inspired in existing buildings within Old Town's historic.
- e. Alexandria's heritage architecture is carried into the proposed design with a subtle vertical contemporary staggered-rhythm fenestration and rusticated brick layering.
7. The massing and proportions of new buildings or additions to existing buildings designed in an historic style found elsewhere along Washington Street shall be consistent with the massing and proportions of that style.
- a. The existing building was not designed in a historic style; this guideline is N/A.
8. New or untried approaches to design which result in new buildings or additions to existing buildings that have no historic basis in Alexandria or that are not consistent with an historic style in scale, massing and detailing are not appropriate.
- a. The Applicant is not seeking a new or untried design approach in its addition.
9. Facades of building generally shall express the 20-to-40-foot bay width typically found on early 19 th  century commercial buildings. . . .or, the 15-to-20-foot bay width found on townhouses. . . Techniques to express such typical by width shall includes changes in material, articulation of the wall surfaces, changes in fenestration patterns, varying roof heights and physical breaks, vertical as well as horizontal, within the massing.
- a. Windows are grouped together in +/- 15' intervals and are composed of tall, punched window openings, as an homage to historic townhomes in their scale (rather than the expansive linear ribbon windows from the existing retro office building).

- b. The existing retrofitted office building windows will be replaced into operable units more residential in character.
10. Building materials characteristic of buildings having historic architectural merit within the district shall  be utilized.  The texture, tone and color of such materials shall display a level of variety, quality and richness at least equal to that found abundantly in the historic setting.
- a. The proposed material largely consists of brick, which is the predominant building façade material in the nearby area.  The proposed addition brick color will be a light buff/white combined with rusticated black brick accents to reinforce the vertical composition and separate new from existing. Black brick will be used for stoops and knee walls to contrast with the building structure.
- b. The proposed addition hyphens, interior core and penthouse will be treated in metal and glass.
11. Construction shall reflect the traditional fenestration patterns found within the [historic district].  Traditional solid-void relationships exhibited within the district's streetscapes shall be used in building facades.
- a. The proposed fenestration pattern is approximately 1.7:1 (solid:void), as compared to +/- 1.8:1 in the fenestration pattern of the neighboring townhouses.
- b. The proposed addition expression is strongly vertical relating to Alexandria's historical architecture, and in a syncopated rhythm relating to its time.
12. Construction shall display a level of ornamentation, detail and use of quality materials consistent with buildings having historic architectural merit found within the district.  In replicative building construction (i.e. masonry bearing wall by a veneer system), the proper thicknesses of materials shall be expressed particularly through the use of sufficient reveals around wall openings.
- a. Acknowledged; vertical brick accents have been introduced to highlight the subtle curved façade facing E Abingdon. Dark rusticated brick has been introduced to highlight the vertical fenestration expression.
- b. Openings in the brick facades will be recessed with jamb brick returns as permitted by the standard of practice construction systems.

## 1.  Introduction

Ramey  Kemp  Associates  has prepared a multimodal assessment and trip generation memorandum for the proposed redevelopment of the 1201 E. Abingdon Drive property. The block is bounded by an apartment building to the north, townhouses to the south, E. Abingdon Drive to the west, and N. St. Asaph Street to the east. The subject property is currently occupied by  a  105,926  square  foot  (SF)  of  office  building  with  structured  and  surface  parking.  The Applicant proposes to redevelop the existing site  with approximately 136 dwelling units  and below-grade parking with approximately 164 spaces. The site location is shown on Figure 1.

As mentioned above, the existing office space would be re-purposed with 136 units of residential units. The proposal would be served by approximately 164 parking spaces in two (2) levels of below-grade parking. One (1) loading space is proposed along the northern site access alleyway. Access to the parking garage would be located at the northwest corner of the site on E. Abingdon Drive. A reduced version of the concept plan is shown on Figure 2.

It is a goal of the City of Alexandria to create an integrated, multimodal transportation system that is accessible and safe for all users, including pedestrians and bicyclists. To help achieve this goal, the City Council adopted a Complete Streets Policy in 2010. The term Complete Streets describes a comprehensive, integrated transportation network with infrastructure and design that  allows  safe  and  convenient  travel  along  and  across  streets  for  all  users.  The  policy  is intended to promote  equality for pedestrians, bicyclists, riders and  drivers of public transportation,  as  well  as  drivers  of  other  motor  vehicles.  Further,  the  policy  is  intended  to promote  equality  for  people  of  all  ages  and  abilities,  including  children,  older  adults,  and individuals with disabilities. The study area includes bicycle and pedestrian data, analysis and reporting of infrastructure within a 1/8- mile radius from the site. An integrated transportation system will allow for the subject property to encourage users to utilize alternative modes of transportation in lieu of single occupancy vehicles when traveling to and from the site.

## 3. Pedestrian Facilities

The Old Town North Small Area Plan has a connected network of sidewalks that provides the safe and efficient movement of pedestrians between residences, places of employment, retail shops, open space, transit facilities and other destinations within the area.  A review of existing conditions confirms that within 1/8-mile from the subject site, as shown on Figure 3, sidewalks are present along both sides of all streets.

There is one (1) signalized intersection within the pedestrian and bicycle 1/8-mile study area. A review of the existing signalized intersection confirms that crosswalks are provided across each leg.    Every  crosswalk  provides  pedestrian  ramps  connecting  the  sidewalks  on  either  side. Pedestrian  countdown  heads  are  provided  for  each  marked  crosswalk  at  the  signalized intersection as shown on Figure 3.

## 4. Public Transit Services, Nearby Bicycle Network, &amp; Pedestrian Access

The Old Town North is well served by transit as shown on Figure 4. This includes DASH bus, Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), Metrobus, and Metrorail.

## 4.1. Metrorail Service

The Braddock Road Metrorail station is located approximately 0.6 miles (straight line distance) west of the subject site. This station is served by both the Yellow and Blue Lines. The subject property is located slightly outside of the ½ mile walkshed from the station based on the City of Alexandria Metro Station Walkshed Map.

## 4.2 WMATA/DASH Bus Services

DASH service is provided by line 34 in the vicinity of the site as shown on Figure 4. Line 34 provides service from Lee Center to the Braddock Road Metrorail station; additional stops include City Hall/Market Square and Bashford Lane &amp; N. Pitt Street.

WMATA service is provided by line DC3 in the vicinity of the site as shown on Figure 4. Line DC3 provides  service  from  Mount  Vernon  to  Potomac  Park;  additional  stops  include  George Washington Parkway &amp; Alexandria Ave., Hunting Point, and Abingdon Drive &amp; Slaters Lane.

## 4.3 Metroway

Metroway is a BRT system which operates with dedicated travel lanes along a portion of the route from U.S. Route 1/Potomac Avenue to U.S. Route 1/East Glebe Road. Service began in August 2014 and replaced the 9S line. Service is provided between the Braddock Road and Pentagon City Metro stations, via the Crystal City-Potomac Yard Transitway. Buses run every six minutes from Crystal City to Potomac Yard and every 12 minutes between Braddock Road and Pentagon City. They run every 12 minutes to 15 minutes on off-peak times during weekdays and every 20 minutes on weekends. The closest stop to the subject site is located at Braddock Road Metrorail Station. The subject property is located within the ½ mile walkshed of BRT based on the City of Alexandria BRT Walkshed Map.

## 4.4 Bicycle Network

As shown on Figure 5, within the vicinity of the site, N. Royal Street (to the east) has shared lane markings for bicycles. This route connects to the Mount Vernon Trail that run to the north and south of the site.

Currently, the closest Capital Bikeshare facility to the subject site exists to the west at the intersection of Powhatan Street &amp; Bashford Lane (15 docks), as shown on Figure 5. Capital Bikeshare is also available at the N. Pitt Street &amp; Montgomery Street intersection (14 docks). The closest bicycle shop to the subject site is located at 302 Montgomery Street.

## 4.5 Pedestrian Access to/from 1201 E. Abingdon Drive

Access for pedestrians is facilitated by sidewalks along E. Abingdon Drive, N. St. Asaph Street, and Bellvue Place. Marked crosswalks and ADA ramps exist on all quadrants of the intersection of E. Abingdon &amp; Bashford Lane, this intersection allows pedestrians to cross George Washington Memorial Parkway.

The nearest transit stop is located southwest of the site (WMATA DC3 Line). The Braddock Road Metrorail station is approximately 0.6 miles west of the site and is accessible via a connected grid of sidewalks.

According to walkscore.com, 1201 E. Abingdon Drive has a walkscore of 84, Very Walkable, transit score of 60, Good Transit, and bike score of 89, Very Bikeable, due to the presence of transit and bike amenities near the site. Based on the City's walkability worksheet, included as Attachment 1, 1201 E. Abingdon Drive has a walkscore of 79.

TOGETHER WE ARE LIMITLESS

## 5. On-Street Parking Restrictions

On-street parking restrictions along Bashford Lane, N. Pitt Street, and 2nd Street are shown on Figure 6. The proposal will reduce the existing curb cuts on the property from three (3) to two (2).

## 6. Trip Generation

The trip generation analysis prepared for the proposed redevelopment on 1201 E. Abingdon Drive is based on the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, 11th edition. The site is currently occupied by an office building consisting of approximately 105,926 square feet (SF) of space. Vehicular access to the surface parking lots is currently provided via two (2) curb cuts along E. Abingdon Drive.

The trip generation analysis for the proposed multifamily residential building and a comparison to the existing use is presented in Table 1. These calculations are based on unfractured ITE trip generation rates/equations for ITE land uses codes 710 (General Office) and 221 (Multifamily Housing - Mid-rise). The trip generation provided in Table 1 is based on non-reduced rates, consistent with the requirements of determining whether a traffic study is required. Based on the  transit-oriented  surroundings  of  the  site,  a  non-auto  reduction  is  anticipated  but  is  not allowed to be applied for purposes of this memorandum.

As shown in Table 1, the proposed development would generate 128 fewer weekday AM peak hour trips and 121 fewer weekday PM peak hour trips in comparison to the existing use. As shown in Table 1A, the proposed development would generate 89 fewer weekday AM trips and 85 fewer weekday PM trips assuming a 30% non-auto reduction.

## 7. Transportation Management Plan (TMP)

A  TMP  is  a  site-specific  plan  of  Transportation  Demand  Management  (TDM)  strategies  to encourage residents and employees to take public transportation, walk, bike or share a ride, as opposed to driving alone. The TMP is required by the zoning ordinance through the City's development review process, depending on the size of the development.

TOGETHER WE ARE LIMITLESS

## Multimodal Assessment &amp; Trip Generation Analysis

The ordinance requires that projects submit a Special Use Permit application which must include a multimodal transportation study and a Transportation Management Plan. The thresholds for developments requiring a TMP for the proposed uses are 20 residential units. Generally, there are three types of TMP tiers that determine program participation: Tier 1 TMPs are for smaller developments, Tier 2 for mid-sized developments and Tier 3 for larger developments. Based on the development program assumed in the trip generation, the proposal would be classified as a Tier 2 TMP (residential).

Tier 2 TMPs have the option of joining the Citywide TDM program, operating their own standalone TDM program, or partnering with an adjacent TDM program. Joining the Citywide program requires payments to the TDM fund and allows the City to implement TDM measures such as surveys, mailings and hosting events to encourage participation.

## 8. Conclusion

The site is estimated to reduce the number of peak hour and daily trips generated by the site compared to the existing office use. Therefore, it is unlikely additional analysis would identify any impacts on the surrounding roadway network. We request confirmation that this document serves  as  the  required  multimodal  transportation  and  trip  generation  assessment  of  the proposed development and that nothing additional would be required of the Applicant.

SUBJECT:

DSUP #2023-10012, REZ #2023-00006, &amp; MPA #2023-00008/1201 EAST ABINGDON DRIVE

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## ISSUE :

This application involves a rezoning from the OCM(50) to the CRMU-X Zone. Per 5-407 the maximum permitted height in the CRMU-X Zone is established by the Old Town North Small Area Plan. As a result, the Master Plan Amendment (MPA) associated with the application sets the maximum zoning height for the project. The application highlights the challenge in determining and evaluating affordable housing contributions involving rezoning requests for additional floor area associated with MPA for height that sets the zoning height. As noted in the staff report, staff viewed the additional floor area through the 5 th floor  in  the  project  as  being  subject  to  the  Rezoning  Housing  Contribution  Policy  and  the  floor  area associated with the proposed 6 th floor through a bonus density and height-like lens. In a 136-unit project, this two-pronged analytical approach yields seven committed affordable units (CAUs). In contrast, the applicant viewed all the additional floor area as being subject to the Rezoning Housing Contribution Policy only. This approach yields four to five CAUs; it is noted that the applicant voluntarily agreed to provide additional CAUs for a total of seven, which was the contribution offered in the Affordable Housing Plan reviewed and approved by the Alexandria Housing Affordability Advisory Committee (AHAAC).

The applicant's subsequent request for flexibility to increase the total unit count from 136 to up to 144 units triggered a review of the unit count and mix of the CAUs (consistent with City practices), and a reassessment of staff's approach to the affordable housing contribution.

## STAFF RESPONSE :

The City's authority to require affordable housing stems from Virginia Code § 15.2-2304 which serves as a legal basis for the City's affordable housing bonus density zoning tools, including the Rezoning Housing Contribution Policy. Following further staff discussions regarding the divergent interpretations by staff and the applicant, it was concluded that there was not a clear existing City policy on how to address rezoning requests that involve MPAs for height. Since staff and the applicant had reached an agreement regarding the CAU count (seven) it was reasonable for the CAU mix to be proportional to the project's overall unit mix as determined at the time of Final Site Plan. (Proportionality is Housing's typical practice, however the proposed increase in the number of total units results in a different (smaller) unit mix than at the time of AHAAC's review.) These changes result in changes to Conditions 101 and 113. In addition, it

is noted that staff also recommend the deletion of the second sentence in Condition 101 as this provision only applies to the affordable homeownership units.

Therefore, staff propose the following condition changes:

Condition 101: Provide seven (7) set aside rental units within the development, comprising one (1) one-bedroom, four (4) one-bedroom plus den, and two (2) two-bedroom units, with a unit mix proportional to the project's total unit mix, or an substantially equivalent mix of seven units to the satisfaction of the Director of Housing to be finalized prior to the release of the Final Site Plan. For the purposes of the seta side units, dens are defined as being enclosed with a door, having a  minimum  of  70  square  feet  of  floor  area,  being  no  less  than  seven  feet  in  any  horizontal dimension, and not housing any substantial mechanical equipment. (Housing)

Condition 113: Should the project develop as or convert to residential condominiums, provide no fewer than seven (7) affordable set-aside for-sale units within the development, comprising one (1)  one-bedroom  unit  for  sale  at  $225,000,  four  (4)  one-bedroom  plus  den  units  for  sale  at $250,000, and two (2) two-bedroom units for sale at $275,000, with a unit mix proportional to the project's total unit mix, or a substantially equivalent mix of seven units to the satisfaction of the Director of Housing to be finalized prior to the release of the Final Site Plan. The units will be  priced  consistent  with  the  City  sale  prices  and  policies  in  effect  at  the  time  of  the application's approval by City Council. These prices include the cost of one parking space per unit. Set-aside units sold without a parking space shall be subject to a $30,000 price deduction. For the purposes of the set-aside units, dens are defined as being enclosed with a door, having a minimum of 70 square feet of floor area, being no less than seven feet in any horizontal dimension, and not housing any substantial mechanical equipment. (Housing)

Condition 52. Provide a City standard bus-shelter, with the ability to accommodate future real time bus information LED screens, and electric connections, for the WMATA 11Y bus stop located immediately adjacent to the site, to the satisfaction of the Director of T&amp;ES. The final bus shelter and bus stop bench design shall meet City standards and the approval of the Director of T&amp;ES. Design and specifications for the City standard bus shelter are at: www.alexandriava.gov/6548. Bus shelters require a building permit. (T&amp;ES) (Code) *

## STAFF RECOMMENDATION :

As part of staff's review and analysis, staff considered how a condition to provide a bus shelter for the WMATA stop adjacent to the site would offset an impact that would be created by the implementation of the proposed project and staff notes the following reasons establish this:

- The project will introduce 250-330 new residents (including residents of seven committed affordable units who been shown to have higher rates of public transit use) to this block of Old Town North and a key element of the OTNSAP is to expand transit and enhance the neighborhood as a transit-rich area. The increase in residents will put greater demand on the existing bus stop/pad; thus, a bus shelter is needed to provide shelter from the elements during inclement weather and to provide a better user experience with the associated amenities for a larger number of bus riders.  Shelter has been found essential to encourage and promote ridership by creating a comfortable and accessible experience.
- There is currently a bus stop/pad at this location that serves the 11Y bus, which is a commuter route running north and south from Mt. Vernon Memorial Highway to the south to Downtown Washington, D.C. to the north, with headway intervals of approximately 15-20 minutes during

morning and afternoon peak hours. The existing 11Y bus stop to the north, at Abingdon and Slaters, has a shelter and various WMATA 11A/11C/11n/11 routes have shelters along North Washington Street and a primary north-south artery that links major employment hubs in the region.

- The bus pad immediately to the south was installed as a required condition for the Abingdon Row development, which includes a total of 19 residential townhouse units (City previously identified this need to support the new townhouse residents). The current bus pad is deficient in meeting the needs of this many additional residents as multifamily buildings necessitate shelters to accommodate the increased demand.
- While the residential project generates fewer overall trips than a fully occupied office building, the nature of the trips is quite different and the presence of the 11Y commuter bus route will serve the residents by providing an enhanced public transit option, including for commuter use.
- The purpose provision of the CRMU-X zone, to which the applicant is requesting a rezoning, includes the minimization of automobile travel and locating housing in proximity to a mix of uses, creating a transit-rich environment to support increased densities.

Additionally, Staff has prepared a response to the five (5) project benefits cited by the applicant in the enclosed letter.

1. Reducing the overall vehicular traffic generation for the property;
- While the residential project generates fewer overall trips than a fully occupied office building, the nature of the trips is quite different and the presence of the 11Y commuter bus route will be an amenity for the residents who live in this building. A guiding principle of the OTNSAP is to 'create a mix of uses with transit options offering a lifestyle that is independent of automobiles.'  Therefore, while proposing to reduce overall vehicular traffic for the site by nature of the proposed use, the project must also seek to enhance transit options and reduce automobile dependency.
- The proposed project did not meet the threshold to require a full transportation study. Thus, Staff has referenced the mode split 1 of nearby developments within Old Town North that would likely be comparable to the mode split for this site:
4. o The Gables: 30% mode-split
5. o 901 North Pitt Street: 30% mode-split
6. o Montgomery Center: 40% mode-split

These are comparable projects in the vicinity and staff would expect a similar mode split of 30-40%, given the similarities.  Improvements to transit  and the streetscape help achieve the non-auto mode split.

2. Meeting the City parking requirements;
- Meeting the City's parking requirements does not remove the need for providing transit and streetscape improvements that contribute to reducing residents' dependency on automobile trips.  For example, wider sidewalks and new street lights are routine contributions as conditions of approval to promote the multimodal options around the site.

1 Mode split or modal share refers to the percentage of non-auto trips anticipated to be generated.  Therefore a 40% mode split would have 40% of all trips as non-auto (i.e., walking, biking, transit).

3. Complying with the City TMP requirements;
- Developments greater than 20 multifamily units are required to participate in the City's TMP program and the applicant has agreed to participate in the City-led program. As the project falls under the City's new TMP requirements, they are eligible for deductions of up to 25% for contributions such as Capital Bikeshare ('Cabi') and bus shelters.  Assuming the shelter costs $30k, and based on other parameters of this specific project such as the $20k Capital Bikeshare contribution, the applicant would receive approximately $12,500 reduction in their TMP payments over a 30-yr lifespan; or $416.67 per annum.
4. Contributing towards the Old Town North Implementation Fund;
- The developer contributions to the Old Town North Implementation Fund are targeted for the acquisition, design and construction of the proposed linear park.

These funds are not allocated for the use of any transportation-related improvements.

5. Contributing $20,000 to the Capital Bike Share program.
- Although Staff acknowledges the high volume of city residents who use Capital Bikeshare, this is independent from the request for a standard bus shelter and Capital Bikeshare contributions are required of every residential development project and serve public transit in a different form.

In summary, staff recommends that the Planning Commission recommend approval of Condition 52 to provide a City-standard bus shelter for the purpose of providing for the increased transit needs of the residents.

RE:

Docket Item 4, Development Special Use Permit #2023-10012

Dear Chairman Macek and Members of the Planning Commission:

On behalf of my client, PF III Abingdon, LLC (the 'Applicant'), I respectfully request that the Planning Commission delete staff recommended DSUP Condition 52, which states:

Condition 52. Provide a City standard bus-shelter, with the ability to accommodate future real time bus information LED screens, and electric connections, for the WMATA 11Y bus stop located immediately adjacent to the site, to the satisfaction of the Director of T&amp;ES. The final bus shelter and bus stop bench design shall meet City standards and the approval of the Director of T&amp;ES. Design and specifications for the City standard bus shelter are at: www.alexandriava.gov/6548. Bus shelters require a building permit. (T&amp;ES) (Code) *

Staff's recommendation for an offsite bus shelter has no nexus to the proposed application. With this application, the Applicant is: 1) reducing the overall vehicular traffic generation for the property; 2) meeting the City parking requirements; 3) complying with the City TMP requirements; 4) contributing towards the Old Town North implementation Fund; and 5) contributing $20,000 to the Capital Bike Share program.  If the Planning Commission does find there is a nexus, the City must then satisfy the requirement that the proposed condition has a 'rough proportionality' which requires a 'reasonable relationship' between the impact of a project and the proposed condition. The City cannot meet this burden because this application is reducing the overall traffic from the site and meeting all other City policies aimed at addressing transportation improvements for new projects.

I look forward to discussing this application and this requested change at tomorrow's Planning Commission hearing.

Subject: Comments on docket item #4

## Good afternoon,

YIMBYs of Northern Virginia would like to submit comments (attached) on docket item #4 for Tuesday's Planning Commission meeting.

Thank you!

Phoebe Coy

## 4 February 2023

## Members of the Alexandria Planning Commission,

As the Alexandria leadership team for YIMBYs of Northern Virginia, we enthusiastically support the office-to-residential conversion at 1201 East Abingdon Drive. Alexandria desperately needs more homes to support everyone who works and goes to school in our region. This project will convert an underutilized 1980s office building into 136-144 badly needed rental homes, including 7 committed affordable units, providing more opportunities to live in the wonderful Old Town North neighborhood.

The project will also benefit the whole community by substantially improving sidewalks, adding a bus shelter, and replacing a large surface parking lot with an attractive courtyard and new building wing.

We hope Alexandria will continue to welcome new homes of all types, all price points, and in all parts of our city to address our regional housing crisis and make our city better for everyone.

Phoebe Coy, Alex Goyette, Luca Gattoni-Celli, Peter Sutherland, Stephanie Elms, and Trip Hook YIMBYs of Northern Virginia Alexandria leads
