## Arbor Week Activities

Arbor Week kicked off Monday morning with the TDBank Seedling giveaway, with some time spent at Middle/Main Street Branch in Lewiston and some time spent at the Great Falls Auburn Branch.  Dave Griswold, Steve Murch and Rick Shea participated. On May 22; Dave returned to the banks to thank the managers. !

Monday afternoon Rick Shea and Dave Griswold were able to attend MFS Project Canopy Arbor Week Event in Kennebunkport to represent LACFB.  Auburn and Lewiston  received their  12 th  year Tree City USA Awards. !

In preparation for tree planting, Dan spent a lot of time on the tractor and early Tuesday, Steve and his crew arrived to oversee the tree planting.  The Edward Little students arrived and planted approximately 24 elms and 6 variety with the help of SteveÕs crew, Dave and Rick.  Additional elms and serviceberries will be planted during the week of May 26 Ð 29, bringing the total to 60 trees.  By June of 2016, the plan is to increase the number of trees to 250- 300.  In 6 Ð 8 years, these trees should be ready to move to city streets, and will be valued at about $40,000. !

## Nursery Tour/Next Actions

Steve says the MFS Project Canopy grant has paid for trees, fertilizer &amp; supplies, the conduit is already in and 220 service will be installed for the well; we now need a better pump.   Work will commence late this summer to get the nursery area ready for the tree planting next spring.

Members take the opportunity to tour the newly planted trees at the nursery noting that the original 9x9 checkerboard  pattern has been changed, rows are to be planted but spacing is a big consideration for planting.  Steve pointed out a couple of the exposed tree bags and gave an explanation of how the bags are supposed to work; eliminating the need for digging out with a spade.  The strong root area is contained in the bags and the entire needed root network comes out with the bag for transplant. !

Steve and Dan have discussed what the watering options are in the event of a drought; as well as the concern for how they are going to control the pests; namely deer and mice. !

## Conservation Commission Update
