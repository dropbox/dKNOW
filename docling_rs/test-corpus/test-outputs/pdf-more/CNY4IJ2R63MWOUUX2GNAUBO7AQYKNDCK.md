This report is based on 530 surveys with New York State farmworkers on more than one hundred farms. This is the largest number of the stateÕs migrant, seasonal, and year-round farmworkers to participate in a single survey. 1 The goal of the survey was to collect data about farmworkersÕ on-the-job injuries, compensation for lost worktime, working hours, and wages. This survey also sought to evaluate the implementation of the overtime provision of New YorkÕs 2019 Farm Laborers Fair Labor Practices Act (FLPA).

Historically, farmworker voices have been absent in public discussions of New York farmworker policy. The stateÕs farmworkers are generally not citizensÑthey are undocumented and guestworkersÑso they have good reasons to hesitate before speaking up about problems related to their workplaces, particularly if their housing is tied to their jobs. Many farmworkers fear that their employer may retaliate against them by cutting their hours, firing them, illegally evicting them, or calling immigration authorities. 2 This report foregrounds farmworkersÕ experiences and opinions to help mitigate the absence of their voices in policy debates about their working conditions and wellbeing.

## KEY	FINDINGS

## Respondent Demographics:

- ∞ 63% of respondents are from Long Island and 37% are from Upstate.
- ∞ The vast majority of respondents (91%) hail from two regionsÑLong Island (63%) and the Finger Lakes (28%).
- ∞ Men are 55% of respondents and women are 45%.
- ∞ The main sectors represented in this data are nurseries (21%), greenhouses (21%), vineyards (20%), fruit and vegetable farms (17%), and dairies (16%).

## Lost-Worktime Injuries:

- ∞ 19% of respondents reported having a workplace injury that resulted in lost worktime.
- ∞ 33% of those with a lost-worktime injury are employed in dairy and 24% work on fruit and vegetable farms.
- ∞ The percent of Upstate respondents (29%) who reported a lost-worktime injury is more than double the percent of Long Island respondents (13%) who reported a lost-worktime injury.

## Executive	Summary

Percentages of ten or more are rounded to the nearest whole number; as a result, for some responses, the sum of percentages may not equal 100.

These data do not cover all workplace injuries, only those that resulted in lost worktime.

Farm injuries are a significant problem.

Compared to other workers, farmworkers have fewer safety protections, reduced

access to medical care, and "noteworthy

The data reveal that almost one-fifth of respondents reported losing worktime as a result of being injured. Upstate dairy respondents reported the highest rate of lost-worktime injuries. Note that research reveals that many farmworkers continue to work even when they are experiencing pain due to a workplace injury. 3

## Payment for Lost-Worktime Injuries:

- ∞ 49% of those who reported having a lost-worktime injury said they did not receive payment of any kind for the lost worktime or medical bills. 4
- ∞ 44% reported receiving some type of payment for lost worktime or medical bills. 5

Of all the findings in this report, the lack of payment for lost-worktime injuries is the most significant, and could potentially have a long-term effect on workersÕ health. The FLPA requires that all agricultural employers provide workersÕ compensation and disability insurance for their employees. Farmworkers are also eligible for paid sick leave under the New York State Sick Leave Law.

It is clear that workers are not pursuing workersÕ compensation claims, nor paid sick leave under the New York State Sick Leave law. This is likely due to lack of knowledge, language barriers, fear, or because some employers take workers to the doctor themselves and pay out of pocket. Workers may not realize that without a workersÕ compensation claim, they will likely have to pay for long-term injuries themselves or just suffer without further treatment.

## Worker Quotes

The injury stories in this report detail workersÕ pain, frustration over lost wages, how medical bills were paid (by respondents themselves or employers, generally not by workersÕ compensation), and feelings that their employers do not care about them. Additional quotes relate to workersÕ thoughts on pay, overtime, days off, union organizing, and other workplace conditions.

## Hours Worked:

- ∞ 56% of respondents reported working 60 or fewer hours a week.
- ∞ 44% reported working more than 60 hours a week.

Farm injuries are a significant problem. Compared to other workers, farmworkers have fewer safety protections, reduced access to medical care, and Ònoteworthy physical and mental health hazards.Ó 4 Research estimates that the federal statistics on work-related nonfatal injuries in agriculture were undercounted by 77.6% 5 (see p. 23).

decreases, workers' income can increase

## Overtime Pay:

- ∞ 72% of respondents who log more than 60 hours a week reported receiving the legally required overtime rate of timeand-a-half after 60 hours.
- ∞ 25% of respondents who log more than 60 hours a week reported not receiving the overtime rate of time-and-a-half after 60 hours (wage theft). 6

The FLPA instituted the first-ever overtime threshold for New York farmworkers at 60 hours. In 2024, as the overtime threshold decreases, workersÕ income can increase without added cost to employers, who are eligible for a refundable tax credit of 118% of the overtime premium. 6 This means farm employers will pay the same as if the overtime threshold was at 60 hours.

The data expose wage theftÑone in four respondents who work more than 60 hours a week said their employer violated their right to overtime pay.

## Method of Wage Payment:

- ∞ 95% of respondents receive either a hard-copy check or direct deposit for their wages.
- ∞ 5% are paid in cash.
- ∞ Less than one percent is paid both in check and cash.

## Hourly Wage:

- ∞ 96% of respondents are paid at least the minimum wage.
- ∞ 4% are paid below the minimum wage (wage theft).
- o Those who are paid below the minimum wage (19 respondents) also reported a higher rate of overtime pay wage theft and a higher rate of injuries that resulted in lost worktime.
- o 32% of those not receiving the minimum wage work in dairy.
- ∞ Statewide: the 2022 average hourly wage is $15.55.
- ∞ Long Island: the 2022 average hourly wage is $16.19, $1.19 more than the minimum wage
- ∞ Upstate: the 2022 average hourly wage is $14.40, $1.20 more than the minimum wage.

The data show that the vast majority of respondents are paid the minimum wage or higher. While the number of respondents receiving less than the minimum wage (wage theft) is small, the data suggest that employers who do not pay the minimum wage also tend to violate other worker protections and oversee workplaces that are more dangerous.

In 2022 there were different minimum wage rates for Long Island ($15.00) and Upstate New York ($13.20); this accounts for the increased wages on Long Island.

## POLICY	RECOMMENDATIONS

## BIDEN ADMINISTRATION:

Under the Biden administration, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) amended its deferred action program (which temporarily prevents detention or deportation) to include those involved in an active labor investigation. Those granted deferred action are generally permitted to remain and work in the US for an additional two years.

The deferred action program should allow those with a work-related injury or illness to stay in the U.S. for necessary medical treatment, to assure appropriate medical attention for those who contribute their labor to U.S. farms. In addition, H-2A visa holders with a work-related injury should be given extensions on their visas to seek medical attention in the U.S.

## CONGRESS:

Since 1976, Congress has added a small farms rider to the Annual Labor-Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill, which exempts farms with fewer than eleven non-family employees from Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enforcement authority.

<!-- image -->

Prevent the addition of this rider to the Annual Labor-Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill, to address the lack of attention to, and absence of data on, farmworker injuries. This would allow for more accurate data on farm-related injuries and better inform policy decisions about farm safety and health. At a minimum, Congress should allow OSHA to investigate fatalities on all farms. This would improve tracking of work-related fatalities and prevent the miscategorization of fatalities as not work related. This, in turn, would facilitate familiesÕ claims for death benefits from workersÕ compensation.

## THE NEW YORK STATE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR:

Increase funding for the New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL) to conduct outreach to farmworkers to better educate workers about their rights and identify labor law violations . This would help prevent the wage theft revealed in this report and is particularly critical as the agricultural overtime threshold is lowered every two years.

Provide additional funding for the New York State Department of Labor to prioritize antiretaliation reports , a pressing concern as farmworker unionization efforts increase.

Pass the Securing Wages Earned Against Theft Bill (SWEAT) (Senate Bill S1977, Assembly Bill A46) that, in cases of wage theft, would allow an individual, the NYSDOL, or the state Attorney General to file a wage lien on an employerÕs property. This would add an additional mechanism to assure workers are paid for the hours that they worked .

Pass the Empowering People in Rights Enforcement Bill (EMPIRE) (Senate Bill S541A, Assembly Bill A5876A) to allow workers or their representatives to initiate public enforcement actions against employers (currently only the NYSDOL can begin such actions) to compel employers to follow the state labor law. This would expand the enforcement of labor protections and add an additional mechanism to compel employers to respect workersÕ rights.

Create designated funding for community-based organizations to conduct wage theft prevention training with farmworkers. Educating workers about wage laws and how to report wage theft is critical to mitigate the underpayment of farmworker wages .

Pass Senate Bill S1161, Assembly Bill A2034 to increase the workersÕ compensation minimum weekly benefit and set it at one-fifth of the statewide average weekly wage. This would align the New York workersÕ compensation minimum weekly benefit calculation with New Jersey. The current minimum weekly benefit of $150 is inadequate, and unfair to farmworkers whose employers pay them off the books. Increasing the weekly minimum benefit would encourage more injured farmworkers to assert their rights .

<!-- image -->

Increase funding for the New York State WorkersÕ Compensation Board for enforcement and community outreach. This would allow the WorkersÕ Compensation Board to better fulfill its mission and protect the rights of more workers . The WorkersÕ Compensation Board is currently funded by assessments, which is not viable, especially considering the 2 percent cap on the growth of assessments for farmland.

Increase funding for the New York State WorkersÕ Compensation Board to translate decisions and notices, currently only offered in English. Translation of these important documents would create more accessibility for farmworkers who do not read or write in English

Create designated funding for community-based organizations to conduct workersÕ compensation training with farmworkers. Educating workers about workersÕ compensation is vital to ensure that workers who produce our food can secure appropriate medical services when they suffer a work-related injury or illness.

Consider legislation to better educate medical providers about workersÕ compensation , to require them to provide information directly to workers about workersÕ compensation, and to file the standard CMS 1500 medical report in a timely manner.

Consider legislation to improve farmworker access to medical attention , such as requiring employers to transport workers for urgent medical care, this is especially important in remote rural areas.

Pass the Unemployment Bridge Program Bill (Senate Bill S3192, Assembly Bill A482) so that New Yorkers who are not eligible for regular unemployment insurance can receive compensation when they lose their jobs. This would mitigate farmworkersÕ fear of retaliation for reporting unsafe and/or unlawful working conditions.

Pass the State Language Access Bill (Senate Bill S3381A, Assembly Bill A503A), which would extend language access requirements (the translation of documents and forms) to all state and county agencies and departments. Currently this is only required by agencies under the GovernorÕs jurisdiction.

Governor HochulÕs ÒStrategic Industry Task Force Lessening Obstacles to Agriculture (SILO),Ó which addresses labor issues, should include farmworkers and farmers who represent the interests of workers and the unions representing them .

## THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR:

Continue to prioritize addressing anti-retaliation reports from farmworkers, a pressing concern as unionization efforts increase across the state.

Create handouts with large text size and graphics to better educate farmworkers about their rights .

## THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION AND FINANCE:

Create an easy form and process for farm employers to request the 118% refundable tax credit for the overtime premium.

## Background:	New	York	Farmworkers

There is a significant dearth of data on farmworkers in the United States. This absence is particularly striking in contrast to the data available on farm owners and farm operations.

New York farmworkers fit into a variety of categories: seasonal or year-round; hired directly or hired via contractor; and varied legal statuses including citizen, green-card holder, H-2A foreign guestworker, or undocumented immigrant. 7 Some migrant workers (this term excludes H-2A foreign guestworkers) tend to travel from within the United States to New York (typically within the Eastern Seaboard); they come and go in the same year. In contrast, other migrant workers stay in New York for a number of years or indefinitely. Farmworkers who are not U.S. citizens tend to fear that their employer may retaliate against them by cutting their hours, firing them, illegally evicting them, or calling immigration authorities. 8

Crop work is seasonal, although some fruit and vegetable farms hire workers during the off-season months (e.g. to trim fruit trees and engage in farm maintenance). It is not uncommon for seasonal workers to live year-round in New York, including in employer-owned farm labor camps, even if they are not employed in the winter months.

## Number of Farmworkers

There is no definitive estimate of the number of farmworkers in New York. The 2017 Census of Agriculture reports 55,945 employees are included in Òhired farm laborÓ in the state. However, this number includes paid family members as well as Òbookkeepers, office workers, maintenance workers, etc.Ó 9 Additionally, New York farms hire contract workersÑboth domestic and foreignÑincluding H-2A visa holders. The Census of Agriculture does not give a number for contract workers on New York farms. Rather, it reports the contract labor expenses, which comprise 15% of all labor expenses. 10 A 2021 Legal Services Corporation report estimated 53,624 active farmworkers in New York State, including H-2A visa holders and other contract workers. 11

The number of H-2A workers is available. In 2017 (the year of the last Census of Agriculture), there were 5,603 H-2A visa entries to the United States for employment in New York. This is a lower number than the 6,870 positions certified. It is common for farm employers to ask for a higher number of guestworker positions to be approved, since weather and other conditions influence the actual number needed. In 2020, there were 7,406 H-2A visa entries to the United States for work in New York and 9,192 H-2A positions certified. 12 This represents a 32% increase in H-2A visa admissions of those destined for New York farms from 2017 to 2020.

## Demographic Shift

Starting at the end of the 20th century, there was a shift in the composition of New YorkÕs agricultural workforce by race, national origin, and legal status. 13 The number of black farmworkers, including African American and Caribbean-born, declined as the number of Mexican and Central American immigrants grew. There was a corresponding decrease in citizens and green card holders and an increase in undocumented immigrants. The shift also included a decrease in workers who seasonally migrate from another state and an increase in seasonal workers who live year-round in New York . This began in crop work (roughly in the 1980s) and started later in dairy (in the early 2000s).

## Agricultural Worker Defined 14

Sometimes greenhouse, nursery, packing house, vineyard, and others are not considered agricultural employees and are therefore entitled to overtime pay after 40 hours. For example, when a greenhouse purchases plants that only need repotting and watering to be resold, that labor is not considered agricultural labor. 15 If packing house workers pack products from a farm not owned by the same owner, those workers are not considered agricultural employees. 16 Similarly, if vineyard workers do labor in the farmÕs winery, that is not considered agriculture. 17

A workerÕs status is managed on a weekly basisÑsuch workers may be considered agricultural employees for some weeks and not agricultural employees for other weeks. A vineyard worker who, for example, works most of a week outdoors in the vineyard and half a day in the farmÕs winery is not considered an agricultural employee during that week and is entitled to overtime pay after 40 hours. 18

There can be confusion about whether a worker is considered an agricultural employee or not. For example, one of the respondents stated, ÒI fix machinery and the farm considers me a mechanic, but I donÕt get overtime after 40 hours.Ó Even though some mechanics do not engage with livestock or crops, they may be categorized as agricultural employees if the work they do Òcontributes to farm operationsÓ. 19

## Union Organizing

With the passage of the FLPA, New YorkÕs farmworkers earned the right to join a union through a card check process, overseen by the New York Public Employees Relations Board (PERB). Since farmworkers are excluded from federal collective bargaining protections, the National Labor Relations Act does not cover them; therefore a state agency must oversee farmworker unionization. On September 27, 2021, history was made when New YorkÕs first farmworker union was certified by the PERB and RWDSU/UFCW Local 338 became the representative of employees at Pindar Vineyards in Peconic on Long Island.

2022

New YorkÕs Farm Laborers Fair Labor Practices Act (FLPA) changes the definition of employee in the New York Labor Law to include farmworkers; previously, they were excluded from this definition. This means that future changes to state labor law will apply to agriculture. The FLPA also grants farmworkers (as of Jan. 1, 2020):

-  Collective bargaining protections under the authority of the state Public Employees Relations Board (PERB). Strikes are prohibited.
-  Overtime pay at time-and-a-half after 60 hours.
-  A 24-hour day of rest in every calendar week
-  Time-and-a-half pay if a farmworker voluntarily chooses to work on the day of rest, regardless of how many hours they log in that week.
-  Disability insurance, which was not previously required.
-  WorkersÕ compensation. Previously the law only applied to farms with an annual payroll greater than $1,200. The WorkersÕ Compensation law requires employers to report a workplace injury or illness to their insurance carrier in a timely manner. In addition, FLPA changed the WorkersÕ Compensation Law to require supervisors and contractors to report all workplace injuries to the farm employer.
-  Inclusion in New YorkÕs 2018 Paid Family Medical Leave Act.
-  Unemployment insurance on farms with $300 or more payroll in any calendar quarter. Previously the law only applied to farms with an annual payroll greater than $20,000 or farms that employed at least ten employees for 20 weeks of the year. The FLPA also removes the requirement that employers must pay unemployment insurance for H-2A foreign guestworkers.
-  The establishment of a Farm Laborers Wage Board to hold hearings and consider whether to maintain or lower the 60hour overtime threshold.

New YorkÕs Labor Commissioner accepts the Farm Laborers Wage BoardÕs recommendation that the overtime threshold for farmworkers be reduced to 40 hours by 2032. It will be lowered by four hours every two years, starting in 2024.

New York amends the tax code to create a farm employer refundable tax credit of 118% of the overtime premium between the current overtime threshold and 60 hours. 20 Employers can request advance payment. In other words, as the overtime threshold decreases and workersÕ pay increases, employersÕ labor costs should be the same as if the overtime threshold were 60 hours.

## Background:	New	York	Agriculture

Greenhouses

New York State has 33,438 farms 21 spread over 6.9 million acres, which accounts for 21% of New YorkÕs land area. 22 In terms of size, 71% of the stateÕs farms are between 10 and 179 acres and 8.1% are 500 acres or more. The average farm size is 205 acres. Dairy is the largest sector of New York agriculture in terms of land area, accounting for 2.17 million acres or 31% of agricultural land.

New York farms generate $5.4 billion in sales; two-fifths of sales ($2.1 billion) are from crops (including nurseries and greenhouses) and three-fifths of sales ($3.26 billion) derive from livestock, poultry, and their products (see fig. 1). 23 Milk production, with sales at $2.5 billion, is 47% of the stateÕs total agricultural salesÑthe highest, by far, of any agricultural product.

Labor costs account for 20% of the stateÕs total farm expenses. 24 A little more than one-quarter (27%) of New YorkÕs farms have labor expenses; in other words almost three-quarters of farms have no labor expenses. Figure 2 reveals that 62% of total farm labor expenses are incurred by only 2.8% of New York farms; these farms have one million dollars or more in annual sales.

Sixteen New York agricultural products rank in the top five nationally for sales (see table 1).

## Methodology

This descriptive study of New York farmworkers employs a cross-sectional design (looking at data at a specific point in time) to examine respondentsÕ on-the-job injuries, compensation for lost worktime, working hours, and wages, as well as the early implementation of the overtime provision of the FLPA. The Trabajadores Agr'colas Unidos (TAU) coalition generated the survey questions and its union organizers conducted the survey. The coalition includes the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), UFCW Local One, UFCW Local 888, and Local 338 RWDSU/UFCW. The TAU provided the data to the authors. The TAU coalition members were not involved in the data analysis, nor the writing of this report.

## Sample

To survey New York state farmworkers, a convenience sample was employed as opposed to a random sample of the entire population of New York farmworkers. Agricultural laborers were identified based on union organizersÕ previous contacts. Additional respondents were identified through snowball sampling, whereby those who took the survey provided names of potential respondents. The survey also could be completed online. To recruit online respondents, the TAU posted links to the survey on its Facebook page on April 27, 2022. In addition, in the spring of 2022, the Midstate Council on Occupational Safety and Health and the Worker Justice Center of New York both sent text messages with a link to the online survey to their lists of farmworkers.

The survey did not aim to determine which respondents were agricultural workers according to the definition on page 10. Some of the respondents volunteered that they were paid overtime after 40 hours; they were employed in nurseries, greenhouses, and packing houses. As such, some respondents may technically not be agricultural employees. For the purposes of this report, we include their responses for several reasons. The work tasks and working conditions of the non-agricultural-employee respondents are not distinguishable from the agriculturalemployee respondents. Moreover, this data is valuable to service providers and advocates, who often do not know who is technically classified as an agricultural worker and who is not; they help workers regardless.

To be included in the sample, survey respondents had to be employed doing agricultural work tasks in New York after January 1, 2020 (when the FLPA took effect). Survey respondents were not compensated for their participation. This sample is not statistically representative of New YorkÕs farmworker population, since the survey employed a convenience and snowball selection method.

## Data

Sample data for this report are based on 602 in-person, telephone, and online surveys conducted with New York farmworkers between December 1, 2021 and May 15, 2022. The surveys were conducted in Spanish and English by six TAU organizers. Potential survey respondents were contacted either in person or on the phone, received a description of the survey questions, and were asked for oral consent to participate; the survey was either conducted at that time or scheduled for a later time. Eight respondents independently completed the survey online. Surveys were conducted without the knowledge of employers. This is the largest number of the stateÕs migrant, seasonal, and year-round farmworkers to participate in a single survey. 25

The authors received the raw data in a spreadsheet, and cleaned the sample to include only those who met the sample criteria and to remove incomplete and duplicate responses. The final sample had 530 respondents on at least 101 farms (22% of respondents did not report the name of their employer).

Available in Spanish and English, the survey instrument consisted of 13 questions (see Appendix A). These included 12 closed-ended questions and one open-ended question. The questions relate to respondentsÕ workrelated injuries that resulted in lost worktime, their pay, and the number of hours they worked. On average, it took respondents 20 minutes to complete the survey.

<!-- image -->

The open-ended question yielded comments. We included these comments, except for those that were not legible or did not have enough context to stand on their own (e.g. ÒI got hitÓ). For the comments, the following categories were created using content analysis: day of rest, number of hours per week, overtime pay, unions, working conditions, wages, Covid-19, and injuries. For consistency, some comments were edited to appear in the first person. Comments in Spanish were translated into English. Occasionally the authors sought translation assistance with comments, though two of the authors speak and read Spanish proficiently.

Respondents who offered comments about their injuries were contacted a second time by the TAU organizers for clarification and elaboration on their comments. Some details were removed from these injury stories to protect the confidentiality of the respondents.

## Analysis

Since the minimum wage increased from 2021 to 2022, respondents were contacted a second time to update wage data if they completed a survey in December 2021. When that was not possible, wage data were removed, but the remaining survey responses were preserved. All responses were analyzed except for questions nine and ten, which yielded unreliable responses; these are not reported.

Respondent

Long Island respondents account for 63% of the sample and 37% of respondents are from Upstate (see fig. 3).

We use the term ÒUpstateÓ to describe areas of New York that are not Long Island, Westchester, and New York City. Recognizing that this is considered a controversial definition of Upstate, 26 table 2 offers more nuance by depicting the number of respondents from each Upstate region represented in this report. These regions are from New YorkÕs Empire State Development. 27

n = 196

Long Island respondents, all from Suffolk County, make up 63% of the sample. Finger Lake respondents are 28% of the sample (and 76% of Upstate respondents). This requires explanation. Suffolk has the highest number of hired workers in New York and the highest labor costs of any New York countyÑ11% of the stateÕs hired and contract labor expensesÑ spending almost twice as much as the next highest county (Wayne in the Finger Lakes). 28

In addition, among New YorkÕs top ten agricultural counties by number of hired workers, farmworkers in Suffolk are more accessible because of the population density (1,674.7 people per square mile). This is 173% higher than the county ranked second for the number of hired workers, Onondaga in Central New York (612.2 people per square mile), and 859.1% higher than the county ranked third for the number of hired workers, Ontario in the Finger Lakes (174.6 people per square mile). 29 Fruit/Vegetable (17%)

It is also worth noting that Suffolk ranks 16 th nationally of the 2,601 U.S. counties that engage in nursery, greenhouse, floriculture, and sod 30 and second in the state for wine manufacturing. 31 As a result, a high percent of respondents are from the nursery, greenhouse, and vineyard sectors (see fig. 4). 109

The sample data have a high percent of women respondents (45%), compared to the national average (26%). This is due to the high percent of greenhouse and nursery worker respondentsÑ42% of those surveyed (see fig. 4). Women tend to be a greater concentration of the agricultural labor force in New YorkÕs nurseries, greenhouses, and packing houses, compared to other farming sectors. Notably, the share of women farmworkers in the United States has increased in recent years, from 21% in 2012 to 26% in 2019. 32 The percent of women respondents per sector are: 77% greenhouse, 77% packing house (produce), 64% nursery, 36% fruit/vegetable farm, 17% dairy, and 13% vineyard (see table 3).

## Lost-Worktime	Injuries

Farming is one of the most dangerous industries in the United States for laborers and farm owners alike. Farmworkers and their families Òexperience noteworthy physical and mental health hazards,Ó poor access to health services, and farmworkers have fewer health and safety protections than other workers. Furthermore, the fear of retaliation and lost income can lead workers to avoid reporting unsafe working conditions. 33

Figure 6: Lost-Worktime Injuries

<!-- image -->

Almost one in five respondents (19%) reported losing worktime due to an on-the-job injury (see fig. 6). These data do not cover all workplace injuries, only those that resulted in lost worktime. Note that research reveals that many farmworkers continue to work even when they are experiencing pain due to a workplace injury. 34

## Work-Related Nonfatal Injuries

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tracks work-related nonfatal injuries by private industry category. While the BLS is an important source for nonfatal injury data, a 2014 study estimated that the BLS failed to identify 77.6% of work-related nonfatal injuries and illnesses in U.S. agriculture. The study identified behavioral obstacles to reporting injuries, including

employer negligence and Òwillful underreportingÓ by employers or employees. The study also pointed to institutional obstacles for tracking injuries, such as an undercount of workers employed in agriculture, the exclusion of self-employed farmers from reporting requirements, and the fact that the BLS does not report work-related injuries that occur on small farms. 35

The lack of reporting from small farms is a major reason for the undercount of work-related nonfatal injury data in agriculture, since the BLS data exclude farms with fewer than eleven non-family employees. The BLS draws on data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which has been prohibited from regulating smaller farms since 1976. 36

According to the BLS, the highest rate of nonfatal work injuries is in the category Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, 37 with a rate of 4.1 per 100 full-time equivalent (FTE) workers. 38 In the subcategory Crop Production the rate is 4.2 and in the subcategory Animal Production and Aquaculture the rate is 4.8. All private industry categories combined have a work-related nonfatal injury rate of 2.2 per 100 FTE workers. 39

New YorkÕs work-related nonfatal injury rate for the category Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting is 3.2 injuries per 100 FTE workers; the rate in the subcategory of Crop Production is 2.4. There is no 2020 BLS category for New York for the subcategory Animal Production and Aquaculture. The work-related nonfatal injury rate for all industries combined is 2.7 injuries per 100 FTE workers. 40 In contrast to the BLS data, other research on migrant and seasonal farmworkers found the injury rate for New York State was 11.7 injuries per 100 FTE workers. 41

To summarize, the work-related nonfatal injury rate per 100 FTE workers:

- ∞ 4.1 in Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing &amp; Hunting in the United States (BLS).
- ∞ 4.2 in the subcategory Crop Production in the United States (BLS).
- ∞ 4.8 in the subcategory Animal Production and Aquaculture in the United States (BLS).
- ∞ 3.2 in Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing &amp; Hunting in New York (BLS).
- ∞ 2.4 in the subcategory Crop Production in New York (BLS).
- ∞ 11.7 for New YorkÕs migrant and seasonal farmworkers (Brower et al.).
- ∞ Estimated 77.6% undercount of injuries and illnesses by the BLS (Leigh et al.).

## Work-Related Fatalities

There is a noteworthy problem tracking work-related fatalities on small farms due to OSHAÕs lack of enforcement authority on farms with fewer than eleven non-family employees. Without a thorough OSHA investigation, fatalities on small farms can be mistakenly categorized as not work-related.

The BLS reports work-related fatality rates by both occupation and industry. 42 By occupation, farmworkers fall under the category Miscellaneous Agricultural Workers, 43 and have a workrelated fatality rate of 16.6 per 100,000 FTE workers. Additionally, the category Farmers,

"I was out for five weeks with COVID and was paid part of my wages."

40

Ranchers, and Other Agricultural Managers has a work-related fatality rate of 20.9. These rates are much higher than the fatality rate of 3.4 for all occupations. 44

All Other Industry

By industry, the federal fatality rate for the category Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting is 21.5 per 100,000 FTE workers; the subcategory Crop Production has a fatality rate of 20.8; and the subcategory Animal Production and Aquaculture has a rate of 12.8. These rates are much higher than the fatality rate of 3.4 per 100,000 FTE workers for all industries. 45

3.4

2.9

At the state level, New YorkÕs fatality rate for the category Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting is 41.2 per 100,000 FTE workers. This is 14 times the rate of 2.9 for all other industry categories in the state. Construction, with a rate of 11.1, is the next highest industry category. 46 As is evident in figure 7, the fatality rate for the category Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting in New York is almost twice as high as the rate in the nation as a whole.

Roughly half of the respondents (49%) who reported having an on-the-job injury that resulted in lost worktime said they did not receive any payment for the lost worktime (see fig. 8). Keep in mind that workers who should have taken time off for an injury may not have done so.

Of all the findings in this report, the lack of payment for lost-worktime injuries is the most significant, and could potentially have a long-term effect on workersÕ health. The FLPA requires that all agricultural employers provide workersÕ compensation and disability insurance for their employees. Farmworkers are also eligible for paid sick leave under the New York State Sick Leave Law.

It is clear that workers are not pursuing workersÕ compensation claims, nor paid sick leave under the New York State Sick Leave law. This is consistent with a 2000-2001 study of more than 2,000 injuries or illnesses of Northeast migrant and seasonal farmworkers, which demonstrated that only 2.8% applied for workersÕ compensation. 47 This is likely due to lack of knowledge, language barriers, fear, or because some employers take workers to the doctor themselves and pay out of pocket. Workers may not realize that without a workersÕ compensation claim, they will likely have to pay for long-term injuries themselves or just suffer without further treatment.

New York (one of 14 states in which farmworkers are eligible for workersÕ compensation) 48 requires a Òwaiting weekÓ. In other words, eligibility for workersÕ compensation begins on the 8th calendar day of lost worktime. If the lost worktime exceeds 14 days, an employee is eligible to be paid from the initial date of lost worktime; 14 days or fewer, an employee will not be paid workersÕ compensation for the first week. 49

Farmworkers may be eligible for remuneration for that first week under the New York State Sick Leave Law. 50 Yet they have obstacles to accessing workersÕ compensation and paid sick leave, including lack of awareness about the program, limited English language skills, and fear of deportation and employer retaliation. 51

Paid sick leave for New York farmworkers is dependent on a farmÕs number of employees and net income. 52

- ∞ Farms with fewer than five employees and a net income of less than $1 million are only required to provide 40 hours of unpaid sick leave per year.
- ∞ Farms with fewer than five employees and income exceeding $1 million are required to provide 40 hours of paid sick leave per year.
- ∞ Farms with 5-99 employees, regardless of income, are required to provide 40 hours of paid sick leave per year.
- ∞ Farms with 100 or more employees are required to provide 56 hours of paid sick leave per year.
- ∞ Farmworkers accrue one hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked.

When analyzing these data by the other variables, several data points stood out:

Greenhouse

- ∞ The highest lost-worktime injuries by sector were in dairy with 33% of dairy-worker respondents reporting a lost-worktime injury (see table 4).

Vineyard

- ∞ 29% of Upstate respondents, more than double the percent of Long Island respondents (13%), were injured on-the-job and lost worktime.
- ∞ 15% of women and 22% of men reported a lost-worktime injury.
- ∞ 42% of the respondents who are paid below minimum wage reported being injured and losing worktime (8 respondents). This is 121% higher than the 19% of all respondents who reported being injured on the job and losing worktime.

I had to visit the doctor that same day. My boss paid almost all the medical bills. I donÕt remember how much it was. I did not apply for workersÕ compensation and didnÕt have any of the medical records or evidence.

After I was out of work for a bit, I felt pressured to return. They didnÕt threaten anything, but I felt pressure anyway. Also, I really needed to get back to work for myself since I received no pay while I was out of work. I have a family and we rely on my paycheck. Everything requires money.

Most people donÕt know what farm jobs are like. Thank you for interviewing me to gather this information and for caring about what happens to us in this job.Ó

ÒI have hurt both my finger and my back doing farm work. When I hurt my finger, I was in Florida and the boss paid for everything. The back was different. It started to hurt about two years ago as a result of lifting heavy items; this was in New York. I went to the doctor and he said that I had a slipped disk. The doctor didnÕt ask if it was related to work.

I havenÕt taken any time off work due to my back pain, except for the doctorÕs appointmentÑI paid for that. I canÕt afford to take days off work. Some days I am in constant pain.Ó

ÒMy coworker died and I feel awful about this situation, we all do. When he first got sick, the boss paid him for several weeks, but then seemed annoyed that he was out of work and stopped paying him. It really felt like the boss didnÕt care to help him. My coworker went to the doctorÑ we have to pay for that ourselves. I think this might have been related to Covid. This situation makes me think that perhaps itÕs better to return to my home country.Ó

ÒToward the end of a night shift, I was trying to finish my duties and I slipped, ending up with two fractures. I may have been rushing. This was my first time getting injured. I speak a little English, so I could sort of communicate with the orthopedist, who knew this was a work injury.

I was really frustrated because months went by without any pay while I was out of work with this injury. IÕm a father, I have a car loan, and of course I have to pay for food.

Finally, I spoke to someone about getting help and was referred to a farmworker advocate. That advocate taught me my rights as an injured farmworker and I was able to get a lawyer in my native language. The lawyer helped get my paperwork straightened out. In the end, workersÕ compensation covered my lost days of work. This only happened because I found an advocate. I really felt that my employer did not care about me all those months.Ó

ÒThe company is now offering medical insurance and it turns out we pay weekly for this. But it covers absolutely nothing! The clinic that accepts the insurance still charges the workers. Now some of those bills are in collections and the workers donÕt know what to do.Ó

The data exposes wage theft. Of the 44% of workers surveyed who reported working more than 60 hours a week, one quarter were not paid the required time-and-a-half overtime pay (see fig. 10). This requirement began in January 2020 with the implementation of the FLPA.

Seven respondents mentioned they were paid overtime after 40 hours. These were greenhouse workers. Some greenhouse workers are not categorized as agricultural employees by federal or New York law, for example, if they package already grown plants (see the definition of farmworker on p.11). Seven respondents reported that they were told they would be paid time-and-a-half after 60 hours a week, but they do not work more than 60 hours a week.

• 18% are paid $15.01 - $18 per hour.

The average hourly wage of the sample data is $15.55 and the most common hourly wage is $15.00. 53 The vast majority of the survey respondents are paid the minimum wage or higher (96%). Almost two-fifths (39%) of respondents are paid exactly the minimum wage and 57% of respondents are paid more than the minimum wage. In 2020 there were different minimum wage rates for Long Island ($15.00) and Upstate New York ($13.20), which account for the higher wages on Long Island.

n = 530

While the number of respondents experiencing wage theft by being paid below the minimum wage is very small, the data indicate that employers who do not pay the minimum wage also tend to violate other worker protections and have more dangerous workplaces (see table 5). Of the 4% of respondents (19) who do not get paid the minimum wage, nine are on Long Island and ten are Upstate.

Starting in 2017, New York began a series of wage increases to reach a statewide hourly wage of $15.00. The increases vary in terms of region. New York City reached this wage by 2020. Long Island and Westchester were at the $15.00 hourly rate by the beginning of 2022. The remainder of New York State had a minimum hourly wage of $13.20 for 2022 and that increased to $14.20 for 2023. Future increases have yet to be determined. 54

## Policy	Recommendations

## BIDEN ADMINISTRATION:

Under the Biden administration, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) amended its deferred action program (which temporarily prevents detention or deportation) to include those involved in an active labor investigation. Those granted deferred action are generally permitted to remain and work in the US for an additional two years.

The deferred action program should allow those with a work-related injury or illness to stay in the U.S. for necessary medical treatment, to assure appropriate medical attention for those who contribute their labor to U.S. farms. In addition, H-2A visa holders with a work-related injury should be given extensions on their visas to seek medical attention in the U.S.

## CONGRESS:

Since 1976, Congress has added a small farms rider to the Annual Labor-Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill, which exempts farms with fewer than eleven non-family employees from Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enforcement authority.

<!-- image -->

Prevent the addition of this rider to the Annual Labor-Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill, to address the lack of attention to, and absence of data on, farmworker injuries. This would allow for more accurate data on farm-related injuries and better inform policy decisions about farm safety and health. At a minimum, Congress should allow OSHA to investigate fatalities on all farms. This would improve tracking of work-related fatalities and prevent the miscategorization of fatalities as not work related. This, in turn, would facilitate familiesÕ claims for death benefits from workersÕ compensation.

## THE NEW YORK STATE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR:

Increase funding for the New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL) to conduct outreach to farmworkers to better educate workers about their rights and identify labor law violations . This would help prevent the wage theft revealed in this report and is particularly critical as the agricultural overtime threshold is lowered every two years.

Provide additional funding for the New York State Department of Labor to prioritize antiretaliation reports , a pressing concern as farmworker unionization efforts increase.

Pass the Securing Wages Earned Against Theft Bill (SWEAT) (Senate Bill S1977, Assembly Bill A46) that, in cases of wage theft, would allow an individual, the NYSDOL, or the state Attorney General to file a wage lien on an employerÕs property. This would add an additional mechanism to assure workers are paid for the hours that they worked .

Pass the Empowering People in Rights Enforcement Bill (EMPIRE) (Senate Bill S541A, Assembly Bill A5876A) to allow workers or their representatives to initiate public enforcement actions against employers (currently only the NYSDOL can begin such actions) to compel employers to follow the state labor law. This would expand the enforcement of labor protections and add an additional mechanism to compel employers to respect workersÕ rights.

Create designated funding for community-based organizations to conduct wage theft prevention training with farmworkers. Educating workers about wage laws and how to report wage theft is critical to mitigate the underpayment of farmworker wages .

Pass Senate Bill S1161, Assembly Bill A2034 to increase the workersÕ compensation minimum weekly benefit and set it at one-fifth of the statewide average weekly wage. This would align the New York workersÕ compensation minimum weekly benefit calculation with New Jersey. The current minimum weekly benefit of $150 is inadequate, and unfair to farmworkers whose employers pay them off the books. Increasing the weekly minimum benefit would encourage more injured farmworkers to assert their rights .

<!-- image -->

Increase funding for the New York State WorkersÕ Compensation Board for enforcement and community outreach. This would allow the WorkersÕ Compensation Board to better fulfill its mission and protect the rights of more workers . The WorkersÕ Compensation Board is currently funded by assessments, which is not viable, especially considering the two percent cap on the growth of assessments for farmland.

Increase funding for the New York State WorkersÕ Compensation Board to translate decisions and notices, currently only offered in English. Translation of these important documents would create more accessibility for farmworkers who do not read or write in English

Create designated funding for community-based organizations to conduct workersÕ compensation training with farmworkers. Educating workers about workersÕ compensation is vital to ensure that workers who produce our food can secure appropriate medical services when they suffer a work-related injury or illness.

Consider legislation to better educate medical providers about workersÕ compensation , to require them to provide information directly to workers about workersÕ compensation, and to file the standard CMS 1500 medical report in a timely manner.

Consider legislation to improve farmworker access to medical attention , such as requiring employers to transport workers for urgent medical care, this is especially important in remote rural areas.

Pass the Unemployment Bridge Program Bill (Senate Bill S3192, Assembly Bill A482) so that New Yorkers who are not eligible for regular unemployment insurance can receive compensation when they lose their jobs. This would mitigate farmworkersÕ fear of retaliation for reporting unsafe and/or unlawful working conditions.

Pass the State Language Access Bill (Senate Bill S3381A, Assembly Bill A503A), which would extend language access requirements (the translation of documents and forms) to all state and county agencies and departments. Currently this is only required by agencies under the GovernorÕs jurisdiction.

Governor HochulÕs ÒStrategic Industry Task Force Lessening Obstacles to Agriculture (SILO),Ó which addresses labor issues, should include farmworkers and farmers who represent the interests of workers and the unions representing them .

## THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR:

Continue to prioritize addressing anti-retaliation reports from farmworkers, a pressing concern as unionization efforts increase across the state.

Create handouts with large text size and graphics to better educate farmworkers about their rights .

## THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION AND FINANCE:

Create an easy form and process for farm employers to request the 118% refundable tax credit for the overtime premium.

Sometimes the workers are paid directly by the farm employer, even when there is a contractor. Sometimes contractors are paid by the farm employer for all labor and the contractor pays the workers.

38 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) is a unit of measurement that represents a workload of 40 hours a week for 50 weeks of the year. For example, two employees who each work 40 hours a week for 25 weeks would equal one FTE. In addition, one employee who works 60 hours a week for 50 weeks, would equal 1.5 FTE. This allows for fatality and injury rate comparisons across industries by workload. See the Bureau of Labor Statistics definition of incident rate, https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/soii/calculation.htm
