The Arkansas Comprehensive Testing, Assessment, and Accountability Program (ACTAAP) includes Mid-Year and Spring Biology End-of-Course Examinations for students completing Biology for high school graduation credit. The examinations consist of multiple-choice and open-response questions that directly assess student knowledge. The development of the Biology End-of-Course Examinations was based on the Arkansas Biology Science Curriculum Framework .

In January or April 2013, all students who had completed or were completing the required course work for Biology for high school graduation credit participated in the Mid-Year or Spring Biology End-of-Course Examination . Results of the Biology End-of-Course Examinations will be provided to all students, schools, and districts to be used as the basis for instructional change.

This handbook provides information regarding the scoring of student responses to the Biology open-response items. It describes the scoring procedures and the scoring criteria (rubrics) used to assess student responses. Copies of actual student responses are provided, along with scores given to those responses, to illustrate how the scoring criteria were applied to Biology open-response items.

Additional information about the Biology End-of-Course Examination is available through the Arkansas Department of Education. Questions can be addressed to the Office of Student Assessment at 501-682-4558.

## scoring sTudenT responses To open-response iTems

The multiple-choice and open-response test items for the Biology End-of-Course Examination are developed with the assistance and approval of the Biology Content Advisory Committee. This committee comprises active Arkansas educators with expertise in Science education. The Biology Content Advisory Committee develops and reviews multiple-choice and open-response items to ensure that they reflect the Arkansas Biology Science Curriculum Framework .

While multiple-choice items are scored by machine to determine if the student chose the correct answer from four options, responses to open-response items must be scored by trained 'readers' using a pre-established set of scoring criteria.

## reader Training

Readers are trained to score only one content area. Qualified readers for the Arkansas scoring will be those with a four-year college degree in science, education, or related fields.

Before readers are allowed to begin assigning scores to any student responses, they go through intensive training. The first step in that training is for the readers to read the Biology open-response items as they appear in the test booklet and to respond-just as the student test takers are required to do. This step gives the readers some insight into how the students might have responded. The next step is the readers' introduction to the scoring rubric. All of the specific requirements of the rubric are explained by the Scoring Director who has been specifically trained to lead the scoring group. Then responses (anchor papers) that illustrate the score points of the rubric are presented to the readers and discussed. The goal of this discussion is for the readers to understand why a particular response (or type of response) receives a particular score. After discussion of the rubric and anchor papers, readers practice scoring sets of responses that have been prescored and selected for use as training papers. Detailed discussion of the responses and the scores they receive follows.

After three or four of these practice sets, readers are given 'qualifying rounds.' These are additional sets of prescored papers, and, in order to qualify, each reader scoring Biology responses must score in exact agreement on at least 80% of the responses. Readers who do not score within the required rate of agreement are not allowed to score the Biology End-of-Course Examination responses.

Once scoring of the actual student responses begins, readers are monitored constantly throughout the project to ensure that they are scoring according to the criteria. Daily and cumulative statistics are posted and analyzed, and Scoring Directors or Team Leaders reread selected responses scored by the readers. These procedures promote reliable and consistent scoring. Any reader who does not maintain an acceptable level of agreement is dismissed from the project.

## scoring procedures

All student responses to the Biology End-of-Course Examination open-response test items are scored independently by two readers. Those two scores are compared, and responses that receive scores that are non-adjacent (a '1' and a '3,' for example) are scored a third time by a Team Leader or the Scoring Director for resolution.

On the following pages, open-response items are presented as they appeared in the 2013 Mid-Year and Spring Biology End-of-Course Examinations. The specific scoring rubric for each item and annotated responses for each score point of the rubric follows. The goal is for classroom teachers and their students to understand how responses are scored. It is hoped that this understanding will help students see what kind of performance is expected of them on the Biology End-of-Course Examination.

OR Fossils found in different layers can be used to compare and contrast body structures (bones). If changes are found it could be evidence of evolution.         |
|      2 | 1 point possible: Many organisms that have soft bodies would have been destroyed before a fossil could have been formed. OR Organisms decayed too fast for a fossil to be formed.

- C. A new medication for the treatment of high blood pressure is developed by a pharmaceutical company. Research and experimentation has shown it to be safe and effective in non-human animal testing. The next phase is testing on humans. A 'blind study' is proposed in which some patients will receive the medication and others will receive a placebo. Researchers will observe and record any effects of the medication on the disorder, along with possible side-effects. E.
1. Identify the dependent variable in this study. Explain why this is the dependent variable.
