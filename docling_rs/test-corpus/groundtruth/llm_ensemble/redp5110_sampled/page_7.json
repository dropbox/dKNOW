      "text": "Many businesses are trying to limit data access to a need-to-know basis. This security goal means that users should be given access only to the minimum set of data that is required to perform their job. Often, users with object-level access are given access to row and column values that are beyond what their business task requires because that object-level security provides an all-or-nothing solution. For example, object-level controls allow a manager to access data about all employees. Most security policies limit a manager to accessing data only for the employees that they manage.",
