Often, IBM security consultants are asked to perform security assessments for companies without regard to the security policy. Although these assessments can be useful for observing how the system is defined and how data is being accessed, they cannot determine the level of security without a security policy. Without a security policy, it really is not an assessment as much as it is a baseline for monitoring the changes in the security settings that are captured.",

If implemented properly, resource security prevents data breaches from both internal and external intrusions. Resource security controls are closely tied to the part of the security policy that defines who should have access to what information resources. A hacker might be good enough to get through your company firewalls and sift his way through to your system, but if they do not have explicit access to your database, the hacker cannot compromise your information assets.",

The reason is that in today’s connected world there are a multitude of interfaces into the system, from web browsers to PC clients, that bypass application menus. If there are no object-level controls, users of these newer interfaces have an open door to your data.",
