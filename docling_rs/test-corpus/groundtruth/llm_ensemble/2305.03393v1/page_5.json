For example, with the HTML tokens <table>, </table>, <tr>, </tr>, <td> and </td>, one can construct simple table structures without any spanning cells. In reality though, one needs at least 28 HTML tokens to describe the most common complex tables observed in real-world documents [21,22], due to a variety of spanning cells definitions in the HTML token vocabulary.",

      "text": "Obviously, HTML and other general-purpose markup languages were not designed for Im2Seq models. As such, they have some serious drawbacks. First, the token vocabulary needs to be artificially large in order to describe all plausible tabular structures. Since most Im2Seq models use an autoregressive approach, they generate the sequence token by token. Therefore, to reduce inference time, a shorter sequence length is critical. Every table-cell is represented by at least two tokens (<td> and </td>). Furthermore, when tokenizing the HTML structure, one needs to explicitly enumerate possible column-spans and row-spans as words. In practice, this ends up requiring 28 different HTML tokens (when including column- and row-spans up to 10 cells) just to describe every table in the PubTabNet dataset. Clearly, not every token is equally represented, as is depicted in Figure 2. This skewed distribution of tokens in combination with variable token row-length makes it challenging for models to learn the HTML structure.",

Furthermore, every opening tag in HTML needs to be matched by a closing tag in a correct hierarchical manner. Since the number of tokens for each table row and column can vary significantly, especially for large tables with many row- and column-spans, it is complex to verify the consistency of predicted structures during sequence",
