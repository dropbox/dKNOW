      "text": "The design of OTSL allows to validate a table structure easily on an unfinished sequence. The detection of an invalid sequence token is a clear indication of a prediction mistake, however a valid sequence by itself does not guarantee prediction correctness. Different heuristics can be used to correct token errors in an invalid sequence and thus increase the chances for accurate predictions. Such heuristics can be applied either after the prediction of each token, or at the end on the entire predicted sequence. For example a simple heuristic which can correct the predicted OTSL sequence on-the-fly is to verify if the token with the highest prediction confidence invalidates the predicted sequence, and replace it by the token with the next highest confidence until OTSL rules are satisfied.",

Secondly we pick the best hyper-parameters found in the first step and evaluate how OTSL impacts the performance of TableFormer after training on other publicly available data sets (FinTabNet, PubTables-1M [14]). The ground truth (GT) from all data sets has been converted into OTSL format for this purpose, and will be made publicly available.",
