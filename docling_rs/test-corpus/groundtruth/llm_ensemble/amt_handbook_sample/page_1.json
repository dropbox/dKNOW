The nut consists of two parts: a case with a beveled locking shoulder and key and a thread with a locking shoulder and slotted keyway. Until the nut is tightened, it spins on the bolt easily, because the threaded insert is the proper size for the bolt. However, when the nut is seated against a solid surface and tightened, the locking shoulder of the insert is pulled downward and wedged against the locking shoulder of the case. This action compresses the threaded insert and causes it to clench the bolt tightly. The cross-sectional view in Figure 7-27 shows how the key of the case fits into the slotted keyway of the insert so that when the case is turned, the threaded insert is turned with it. Note that the slot is wider than the key. This permits the slot to be narrowed and the insert to be compressed when the nut is tightened.",
