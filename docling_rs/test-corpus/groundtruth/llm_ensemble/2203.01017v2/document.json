          "text": "Tables organize valuable content in a concise and compact representation. This content is extremely valuable for systems such as search engines, Knowledge Graph’s, etc, since they enhance their predictive capabilities. Unfortunately, tables come in a large variety of shapes and sizes. Furthermore, they can have complex column/row-header configurations, multiline rows, different variety of separation lines, missing entries, etc. As such, the correct identification of the table-structure from an image is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we present a new table-structure identification model. The latter improves the latest end-to-end deep learning model (i.e. encoder-dual-decoder from PubTabNet) in two significant ways. First, we introduce a new object detection decoder for table-cells. In this way, we can obtain the content of the table-cells from programmatic PDF’s directly from the PDF source and avoid the training of the custom OCR decoders. This architectural change leads to more accurate table-content extraction and allows us to tackle non-english tables. Second, we replace the LSTM decoders with transformer based decoders. This upgrade improves significantly the previous state-of-the-art tree-editing-distance-score (TEDS) from 91% to 98.5% on simple tables and from 88.7% to 95% on complex tables.",

They often summarise quantitative or factual data, which is cumbersome to describe in verbose text but nevertheless extremely valuable. Unfortunately, this compact representation is often not easy to parse by machines. There are many implicit conventions used to obtain a compact table representation. For example, tables often have complex column- and row-headers in order to reduce duplicated cell content. Lines of different shapes and sizes are leveraged to separate content or indicate a tree structure. Additionally, tables can also have empty/missing table-entries or multi-row textual table-entries.

For the sake of completeness, the issue of table extraction from documents is typically decomposed into two separate challenges, i.e. (1) finding the location of the table(s) on a document-page and (2) finding the structure of a given table in the document. The first problem is called table-location and has been previously addressed [30, 38, 19, 21, 23, 26, 8] with state-of-the-art object-detection networks (e.g. YOLO and later on Mask-RCNN [9]).

The difficulty of the problem can be attributed to a number of factors. First, there is a large variety in the shapes and sizes of tables. Such large variety requires a flexible method. This is especially true for complex column- and row head- ers, which can be extremely intricate and demanding. A second factor of complexity is the lack of data with regard to table-structure. Until the publication of PubTabNet [37], there were no large datasets (i.e. > 100K tables) that pro- vided structure information. This happens primarily due to the fact that tables are notoriously time-consuming to an- notate by hand. However, this has definitely changed in re- cent years with the deliverance of PubTabNet [37], FinTab- Net [36], TableBank [17] etc.",

Such sequences of tokens can be HTML table tags [37, 17] or LaTeX symbols[10]. The choice of sym- bols is ultimately not very important, since one can be trans- formed into the other. There are however subtle variations in the Image-to-Text networks. The easiest network archi- tectures are “image-encoder → text-decoder” (IETD), simi- lar to network architectures that try to provide captions to images [32]. In these IETD networks, one expects as output the LaTeX/HTML string of the entire table, i.e. the sym- bols necessary for creating the table with the content of the table. Another approach is the “image-encoder → dual de- coder” (IEDD) networks. In these type of networks, one has two consecutive decoders with different purposes. The first decoder is the tag-decoder, i.e. it only produces the HTM- L/LaTeX tags which construct an empty table. The second content-decoder uses the encoding of the image in combi- nation with the output encoding of each cell-tag (from the tag-decoder) to generate the textual content of each table cell. The network architecture of IEDD is certainly more elaborate, but it has the advantage that one can pre-train the",

This reliance on a custom, implicit OCR decoder is of course problematic. OCR is a well known and extremely tough problem, that often needs custom training for each individual language. However, the limited availability for non-english content in the current datasets, makes it impractical to apply the IETD and IEDD methods on tables with other languages.

To obtain the table-structure, one creates an initial graph, where each of the text-cells becomes a node in the graph similar to [33, 34, 2]. Each node is then encoded with an embedding vector coming from the encoded image, its coordinates and the encoded appearance of the text. Moreover adjacent text-cells are linked. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN’s) based methods take the image as an input, but also the position of the text-cells and their content [18]. The purpose of a GCN is to transform the input graph into a new graph, which replaces the old links with new ones. The new links then represent the table-structure. With this approach, one can avoid the need to build custom OCR decoders. However, the quality of the reconstructed structure is not comparable to the current state-of-the-art [18].",

Currently, this approach achieves state-of-the-art results, but is not an end-to-end deep-learning method. As such, new rules need to be written if different types of tables are encountered.",

Therefore, it was imperative to introduce a data pre-processing procedure that generates the missing bounding boxes out of the annotation information. This procedure first parses the provided table structure and calculates the dimensions of the most fine-grained grid that covers the table structure. Notice that each table cell may occupy multiple grid squares due to row or column spans.

All the more, our model outperforms pre-trained methods. During the evaluation we do not apply any table filtering. We also provide our baseline results on the SynthTabNet dataset. It has been observed that large tables (e.g., tables that occupy half of the page or more) yield poor predictions. We attribute this issue to the image resizing during the pre-processing step, that produces downsampled images with indistinguishable features. This problem can be addressed by treating such tables with a separate model which accepts a large input image size.",

As shown in Tab. 3, we evaluate our Cell BBox Decoder accuracy for cells with a class label of ‘content’ only using the PASCAL VOC mAP metric for pre-processing and post-processing. Note that we do not have post-processing results for SynthTabNet as images are only provided. To compare the performance of our proposed approach, we’ve integrated TableFormer’s Cell BBox Decoder into EDD architecture. As mentioned previously, the Structure Decoder provides the Cell BBox Decoder with the features needed to predict the bounding box predictions. Therefore, the accuracy of the Structure Decoder directly influences the accuracy of the Cell BBox Decoder.

A table is considered to be simple if it does not contain row spans or column spans. Additionally, a table has a strict HTML structure if every row has the same number of columns after taking into account any row or column spans. Therefore a strict HTML structure looks always rectangular. However, HTML is a lenient encoding format, i.e. tables with rows of different sizes might still be regarded as correct due to implicit display rules. These implicit rules leave room for ambiguity, which we want to avoid. As such, we prefer to have \"stricter\" tables, i.e. tables where every row has exactly the same length.",

As a first step, we use the annotation data to generate the most fine-grained grid that covers the table structure. In case of strict HTML tables, all grid squares are associated with some table cell and in the presence of table spans a cell extends across multiple grid squares. When enough bounding boxes are known for a rectangular table, it is possible to compute the geometrical border lines between the grid rows and columns. Eventually this information is used to generate the missing bounding boxes. Additionally, the existence of unused grid squares indicates that the table rows have unequal number of columns and the overall structure is non-strict. The generation of missing bounding boxes for non-strict HTML tables is ambiguous and therefore quite challenging. Thus, we have decided to simply discard those tables. In case of PubTabNet we have computed missing bounding boxes for 48% of the simple and 69% of the complex tables. Regarding FinTabNet, 68% of the simple and 98% of the complex tables require the generation of bounding boxes.",
