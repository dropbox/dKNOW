# Baseline Corrections

This directory contains documentation for any corrections made to Python baselines.

Each correction MUST have:
1. Independent verification (pdftotext, raw XML, etc.)
2. Hex-level evidence (xxd output)
3. Backup of original Python output
4. Minimal diff

See WORKER_DO_THIS_NOW.txt for full requirements.
