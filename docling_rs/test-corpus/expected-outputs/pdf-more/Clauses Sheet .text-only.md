## HIPAA Confidentiality and Release of Patient Information

The Parties acknowledge that, in connection with this Agreement, they may have access to or receive certain patient health information protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and its implementing regulations ('HIPAA'). Each Party will comply with all applicable HIPAA requirements regarding the use, disclosure, and safeguarding of Protected Health Information ('PHI').

No Party will release, disclose, or allow access to any patient's PHI unless:

- (a) such release is authorized in writing by the patient or the patient's authorized representative in compliance with HIPAA requirements;
- (b) the release is otherwise permitted or required by law; or
- (c) disclosure is required for purposes of providing services under this Agreement and is made in accordance with HIPAA and any applicable Business Associate Agreements.

Each Party will implement and maintain appropriate safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of all PHI in its possession. If any Party becomes aware of an actual or suspected unauthorized access to or disclosure of PHI, it will promptly notify the other Party and take all steps necessary to comply with HIPAA breach notification requirements.

This section will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement with respect to any PHI in a Party's possession.

Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to require any Party to disclose PHI in violation of HIPAA.

Each Party will cooperate with the other to obtain any authorizations or permissions required for release of patient information as needed to fulfill the purposes of this Agreement.
