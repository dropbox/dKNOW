## Hello:

The process of review and revising our participatory governance and organizational structure continues. An open forum is scheduled for Tuesday, March 20, from 12:30-2:00pm to review the revised documents and provide final feedback opportunity.

## Key items to be covered at the forum are:

- Revision of department clusters
- Updated participatory governance handbook and framework

Thank you to everyone that has provided feedback though the review process.
