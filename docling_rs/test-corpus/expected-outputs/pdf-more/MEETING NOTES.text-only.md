## MEETING NOTES

## Agreed Visual Direction:

## Mood &amp; Atmosphere

- Baroque Masquerade meets Surreal Gothic Fantasy Shadow-heavy and theatrical. The world feels like a haunted dream where everything is slightly too perfect, until it breaks.
- Aesthetics something between Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut and Alexander McQueen couture, in a Wes Anderson-level controlled color world.

## Wardrobe

- gowns, corsets, and top hats in gold, velvet red, and ivory
- Feathered things and embroidered textures are strong yeses
- Accessories: Masks are a key feature
- Think drag meets ballroom

## Makeup &amp; Hair

- Sculptural hair, almost like living statues
- Extreme makeups. Again remember drag but maybe only a few.. Go mostly with elegant and chic

## Set Design / Locations

- Rich interiors: wood-paneled libraries, chandeliers, heavy drapery, spiral staircases
- Large ballroom or staged dinner table with candlelight
- Dramatic entrances (would love a good foyer when looking for locations, huge staircases)
- Visual metaphor idea: masks melting or disintegrating over time

## Color Palette

- Deep crimson, jet black, gold, candlelight beige, soft pink, and Victorian brown
- Cream and ivory used sparingly for emotional moments
- Shadows are as important as highlights-contrast is everything

## Camera &amp; Lighting

- Candlelit scenes, soft flickers, slow tracking shots
- Static, wide frames with characters drifting across them-evoking a voyeuristic gaze
- Match cuts through architectural elements (doorways, staircases) for transitions
- Use mirrors and reflections to blur identity, evoke duplicity

## Creative Risks/Challenges

- The team discussed potentially ending the video with a destruction or subversion of the glamour -fire, rain, or sudden stillness
- We brainstormed one surreal element: a slow bleed of red paint/makeup across an ornate wall as time passes

## No No's

- Modern club/party vibes (too casual, broke immersive tone)
- Overuse of fog/smoke (one scene max-it should feel intentional, not theatrical filler)
- All-black looks only -agreed they flatten visual depth in a dark setting; need texture or color contrast
- Literal storytelling (e.g., acting out lyrics)-too on-the-nose, team prefers metaphorical/poetic interpretations
- Digital VFX masks or AR-style effects -felt incongruent with baroque tactile richness
