## Privatization: An unlikely option for USPS

- Privatization:  An unlikely option for USPS profitability before acquisition
- Investors require a clear path to profitability before acquisition
- Changes USPS requires to become attractive to investors are more extensive than those required to ensure a viable government entity
- The scale and associated risk further limit investor interest in the business

Even after a privatization, U.S. Government would need to maintain implicit or explicit support for the

## Closing perspective

Closing perspective Even undertaking all opportunities within Postal Service

Even undertaking all opportunities within Postal Service control, USPS is facing a cumulative $115 billion loss

Actions in any one area will not be enough to close this gap viable operating model

Pursuing multiple actions can result in enhanced customer service and a financially viable operating model from multiple stakeholders

Legislative and regulatory changes are necessary and will require cooperation

from multiple stakeholders
