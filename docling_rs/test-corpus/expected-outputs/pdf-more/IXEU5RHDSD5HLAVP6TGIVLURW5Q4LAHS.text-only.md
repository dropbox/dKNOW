## 2022 Form 140 - Standard Deduction Increase for Charitable Contributions

You  must  complete  this  worksheet  if  you  are  taking  an  increased  standard  deduction  for charitable contributions.   Include the completed worksheet with your tax return, when filed.  If you do not include the completed worksheet, your standard deduction will not be increased.

Taxpayers electing to take the Standard Deduction on their Arizona tax return may increase the  standard  deduction amount by 27% (.27) of the total amount of the taxpayer's charitable deductions that would have been allowed if the taxpayer elected to claim itemized deductions on the Arizona tax return.

Charitable contributions (lines 1C, 2C, and 3C) are those gifts allowed on federal 1040 Schedule A (Gifts to Charity) that you would have claimed had you elected to take itemized deductions on your federal return.

NOTE  1: You  must  reduce  your  contribution  amount  by  the  total  charitable  contributions  you  made  during January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 for which you are claiming an Arizona tax credit under Arizona law for the current tax year return or claimed on the prior tax year return.  Enter this amount on 5C.

NOTE 2: If you itemized deductions on your federal return (1040 Schedule A) and were required to adjust the amount of your allowable contributions on your federal 1040 Schedule A for the amount claimed as a tax credit on your Arizona income tax return, include the amount of the federal contribution adjustment to line 1C and enter the amount of the Arizona tax credit on line 5C.

Complete the worksheet to determine your allowable increased standard deduction for charitable contributions.
