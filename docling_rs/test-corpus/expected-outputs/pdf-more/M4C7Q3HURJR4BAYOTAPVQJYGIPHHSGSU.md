## INTRODUCTION

This manual is designed for the Medication Assistance Supervising (MAS) RN/ LPNs who will train Medication Assistance Certified (MAC) Workers at the agency level. This manual, in addition to the MAC II PowerPoint presentation, provides instructions on training requirements set forth by the Alabama Department of Mental Health (ADMH) and the Alabama Board of Nursing (ABN). The MAC training program has clinical and medico-legal significance. The MAC training program is essential to assuring MAC Workers are competent but also protects the delegating MAS Nurse against potential liability.

The goal of the MAC training program is to provide safe and accurate assistance with medication administration and other nursing tasks that may be delegated by the MAS Nurse. Proper execution of the MAC training program signifies that the MAS Nurse has adhered to the requirements set forth by the ADMH and ABN for training MAC Workers.

The academic skills of non-licensed persons (MAC Workers) will range from a high school diploma or equivalent to advanced college degrees.

Many non-licensed professionals have a limited understanding of normal brain function, mental disorders, and some physical disorders.

Unlicensed professionals may have issues related to stigma. The MAS Nurse shall address these issues and any concerns of the unlicensed professional(s) during the training program.

The MAS Nurse must read the Quick Facts for MAC's Manual , in addition to this manual and the accompanying PowerPoint presentation. The MAS Nurse shall also complete the six MAC I elearning modules. The MAS Nurse must understand the symptoms and management of common mental disorders, physical disorders, and medications. The MAS Nurse must understand that NDP guidelines incorporate state laws related to medication, health, safety, and provision of care for people served through ADMH. The guidelines include regulations set forth by the ABN, ADMH Service Division Regulations, Alabama Board of Pharmacy (ABP), Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH), Department of Human Resources (DHR), as well as OSHA, CDC, FDA, and Medicaid Standards.

The MAC II portion of the MAC training program (hands-on/verification of competency) begins with the MAS Nurse assessment of the MAC candidate's ability to accept responsibility for delegation in a safe and effective manner. The eight (8) hours of MAC II training must include at a minimum:

- Review of MAC I e-learning modules
- Focus on mental disorders
- Common health problems
- Recognizing the change in status

- The MAS-MAC Connection
- Review PRN medication approval including reporting and documenting the person's response
- Review observation of health status including signs and symptoms to report to the MAS Nurse
- Principles of First Aid
- Seizures
- Principles of Infection Control
- Forms
- Documentation
- Vital Signs
- Medical/Nursing Equipment
- Medication Errors
- Assisting with prescribed medications
- Common medications used at your agency
- Common side effects of psychotropic medications
- Monitoring/reporting medication non-compliance
- Emergency Management
- The agency's policies and procedures related to Nurse Delegation

The MAS Nurse has the responsibility to determine if the MAC candidate is competent to function independently as a MAC Worker. MAC certification requires the following five items:

- MAS nurse must verify MAC candidate has a high school diploma/college transcript or GED
- Successful completion of the six MAC I e-learning modules as evidenced by certificates/transcript of completion for each module.
- A minimum of eight hours of face-to-face contact (may extend hours if needed) with the MAC candidate should allow time to determine competency.
- Successful evaluation of skills competency (for all nursing tasks delegated using Skills Checklist - NDP 13) by a MAS Nurse.
- Decision by a MAS Nurse to sign the delegation form with the MAC Worker.

During the MAC II training, the MAS Nurse may choose to emphasize disorders prevalent at their agency. Many persons with mental disorders receive psychotropic medications. Information regarding common medications, metabolic, and other comorbid problems should be included in the training. Any information added shall not contradict facts included in the MAC training program curriculum.

MAC II must be taught by a MAS Nurse (MAS RN/MAS LPN) whose competency has been validated as evidenced by a current certificate of training. The eight hours may be broken into blocks of time equaling eight hours according to agency need and MAS Nurse availability/preference. Once MAC I training is completed, MAC II must be completed within ninety (90) days .  If Direct Care Worker comes to the agency with MAC I training it should be completed 90 days from the hire date .  Training should occur in a supervised environment that is conducive to learning (free of interruptions). Specifically, discuss each learning objective and be sure each objective is met by the MAC candidates.

The MAS Nurse shall use the current PowerPoint presentation, Quick Facts for MAC's Manual, and clinical vignettes of the people served who will be receiving care from the MAC Worker. The use of past situations to highlight issues related to problem-solving is encouraged.

The MAC training program curriculum was developed by a team of nurses, physicians, pharmacists, other ADMH staff, and community providers. All training information is submitted to the ABN for review and approval annually. All practices and guidelines outlined in this manual comply with the existing ABN, ABP, and ADMH regulations.

MAS Nurses and MAC workers must maintain a current certificate to maintain compliance with the NDP and ADMH Certification. All training Certificates have a 90-day grace period to renew after the expiration date on the certificate . This includes the skills check list.

The MAS Nurse must explain the importance of the responsibility associated with assisting with medications as well as other delegated nursing tasks. The humanity of persons served through the ADMH programs must be emphasized.

Every MAC Worker must have access to a copy of the Quick Facts for MAC's Manual to be used by the MAC Worker throughout their employment.

## SECTION 2

## Principles of Delegation

## NOTES TO THE MAS NURSE

The information covered in this section is reference information for the MAS Nurse. This information provides an overview of the principles of the delegation including the American Nurses Association (ANA) Policy Statement and Practice Strategies.

The Alabama Board of Nursing (ABON) Nurse Practice Act states:

| 610-X-2-.06(6)   | Delegation is the act of authorizing a COMPETENT individual to perform SELECTED nursing activities supportive to RN/LPN in SELECTED situations while retaining accountability for the outcome if the delegation is to an unlicensed individual.   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 610-X-6-.03(6)   | The RN/LPN shall be accountable and responsible for the delegation of SELECTED nursing situations tounlicensed individuals.                                                                                                                       |
| 610-X-7-.06(1)   | The RN/LPN who provides care in residential community mental health programs certified by ADMHis accountable and responsible for the nursing care delivered to patients in those settings.                                                        |
| 610-X-7-.06 (2)  | RN/LPN who provides nursing care in the residential community mental health setting and community extensions including day hab programs, may delegate SPECIFIC LIMITED TASKS TO DESIGNATED unlicensed personnel.                                  |
| 610-X-7-.06(3)   | The RN is accountable for determining the tasks that may be safely performed by the unlicensed assistive personne l in residential community mental health settings following appropriate training and demonstration of competency.               |

Delegation refers to the decision by a MAS trained/to sign the delegation form that allows a MAC Worker to assist with the administration of medication.

The Nurse Practice Act (NPA) is the legal authority for nursing practice in each state. According to the ANA Principles for Delegation, RNs are accountable to the public for providing culturally competent, safe, and effective nursing care for persons. RNs function as essential members of health  care  teams  that  include  the  person  and  may  include  other  licensed  professionals  and paraprofessionals as well as assistive health care workers and informal caregivers.

RNs are  accountable  for  supervising  those  to  whom  they  have  delegated  tasks.  RNs  often delegate nursing tasks to other team members, and they are accountable for the decision to delegate and for the adequacy of nursing care to the person. The retains accountability for the outcome of delegation.

The nursing tasks or activities that may be performed by the nursing team, which may include nursing assistive personnel and other health care workers such as s under the direction of an RN, are identified according to legal parameters defined by each state in its nurse practice act and by the scope of practice and standards established by professional nursing organizations. Thus, the framework for clinical practice including delegation is determined by individual state statutes, state regulations, and policy statements and by generally accepted professional nursing standards of practice.

Today's challenges make greater demands on s to have the knowledge and critical thinking skills to effectively delegate to others. These challenges include the varying experience levels of  s,  the  increasing  use  of  assistive  personnel,  and  the  time  required  to  safely  monitor  and supervise the assistive personnel and the delegated work.

With the nursing shortage, inexperienced nurses are more likely to be placed in a  position of having  to  supervise  others  without  sufficient  mentoring.  Inconsistent  facility  or  agency expectations regarding assistive personnel duties coupled with minimal training can lead to an unstable and less qualified workforce. Sicker s, the increased use of technology, and the need to administer medications  place  them in  a position of juggling delivery of  care with  overseeing delegated work. (Principles of Delegation, ANA 2005)

## Policy Statements

'The authority for the practice of nursing is based on a social contract that acknowledges professional  rights  and  responsibilities  as  well  as  mechanisms  for  public  accountability.' (Nursing's Social Policy Statement, ANA 2003)

'Society grants the professions authority over functions vital to itself and permits them considerable autonomy in the conduct of their affairs. In return, the professionals are expected to act responsibly, always mindful of the public trust. Self-regulation to assure quality in performance is at the heart of this relationship. It is the authentic hallmark of a mature profession.' (Donabedian, 1976)

'The RN takes responsibility and accountability for individual nursing practice and determines the appropriate delegation of tasks consistent with the nurse's obligation to provide optimum care'. (Code of Ethics for nurses with Interpretive Statements, ANA 2001)

'The RN assigns or delegates tasks based on the needs and condition of the person, the potential for harm, stability of the person's condition, the complexity of the task, predictability of the outcome, and abilities of the staff to whom the task is delegated.' (Nursing Scope and Standards of Practice, ANA 2003)

'The profession defines the scope and standards of nursing practice. State nurse practice acts define the legal parameters for nursing practice, which include delegation.' (Principles of Delegation, ANA 2005)

'All decisions related to delegation and assignments are based on the fundamental principles of protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the public.' (Joint Statement on Delegation, ANA &amp; NCSBN 2005)

## Principles

The following principles have remained constant since the early 1950s:

## Overarching Principles

- The nursing profession determines the scope of nursing practice.
- The nursing profession defines and supervises the education, training, and utilization of any assistant roles involved in providing direct care.
- The MAS RN takes responsibility and accountability for the provision of nursing practice.
- The MAS RN directs care and determines the appropriate utilization of any assistant involved in providing direct care.
- The MAS RN accepts aid from nursing assistive personnel in providing nursing care for the person.

## Nurse-related Principles

- The MAS RN may delegate elements of care but does not delegate the nursing process itself.
- The MAS RN has the duty to answer for personal actions relating to the nursing process.
- The MAS Nurse considers the knowledge and skills of any individual to whom the MAS Nurse may delegate elements of care.
- The decision of whether to delegate or assign is based upon the MAS RN's judgment concerning the condition of the person, the competence of all members of the nursing team, and the degree of supervision that will be required of the MAS Nurse if a task is delegated.
- The MAS Nurse delegates only those tasks for which he/she believes the other health care worker has the knowledge and skill to perform, taking into consideration training, cultural competence, experience, and facility/agency policies and procedures.
- The MAS Nurse uses critical thinking and professional judgment when following the Five Rights of Delegation:
- o Right task
- o Right circumstances
- o Right person
- o Right directions and communication
- o Right supervision and evaluation
- The  MAS  RN  acknowledges  that  there  is  a  relational  aspect  to  the  delegation  and  that communication is culturally appropriate and the person receiving the communication is treated respectfully. Chief nursing officers are accountable for establishing systems to assess, mentor, verify and communicate ongoing competence requirements in areas related to delegation, both for MAS RNs and delegates.
- MAS RNs monitor organizational policies, procedures, and position descriptions to ensure there  is  no  violation  of  the  nurse  practice  act,  working  with  the  state  board  of  nursing  as necessary.

## Organization-related Principles

- The organization is accountable for delegation through the allocation of resources to ensure sufficient staffing so that the MAS RN can delegate appropriately.
- The organization is accountable for documenting competencies for all staff providing direct care and for ensuring that the MAS RN has access to competency information for all nurses, staff, managers, and administrators.
- The organization ensures that the educational needs of nursing assistive personnel are met through the implementation of a system that allows for nurse input.
- Organizations have policies in place that allow input from nurses indicating that delegation is a professional right and responsibility.

## Practice Strategies

The following practice strategies form the basis of safe and effective delegation:

- All nurses are knowledgeable about the principles of delegation, associated risks and benefits, state laws, and ALL state regulations governing their practice. In reviewing the Alabama Nurse Practice Act, MAS RNs must ask the following questions:
- Does the nurse practice act permit delegation?
- What is the definition of delegation in Alabama?
- Does the nurse practice act also authorize specific tasks for delegation?
- Does the nurse practice act list tasks that cannot be delegated, or does it authorize the MAS Nurse to delegate based upon certain circumstances?
- Does the nurse practice act include a description of the MAC Worker's role?
- Is there a specific definition of supervision in the nurse practice act?
- How does Alabama define supervision or direction when delegating to another healthcare?
- Does the nurse practice act indicate the consequences of inappropriate delegation?
- Does the nurse practice act provide guidelines for reducing delegation risks?
- What is the legal scope of practice for a MAS LPN in Alabama?
- What other healthcare worker roles, if any, are regulated by the state or Nurse Practice Act?
- How are other roles regulated in relation to the MAS RN role? All nurses work together to create effective policies for personal care assignments for staff, delegation, and clinical supervision of team members.
- Nurses understand professional standards of practice as well as the legal parameters for practice.
- Clear, concise job descriptions are developed for each team member , and the NDP Coordinator should be consulted if questions arise regarding the appropriateness of delegating Nursing activities.
- The profession's foundational documents, including Code of Ethics for Nurses with Interpretive Statements, Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, and Nursing's Social Policy Statement, Second Edition ; as well as the Alabama Nurse Practice Act, and other regulatory documents or position statements regarding the role of the MAS RNs assigning care and delegating tasks are available online for all nursing staff.
- MAS RNs educate  organizational  leadership  and  risk  management  staff  on  the  process, education, and training limitations of MAS LPNs, MAC Workers, and other healthcare workers as well as the legal responsibilities of MAS RNs who delegate tasks.
- Language regarding MAS RN liability related to delegation is included in Alabama Nurse Practice Act.
- MAS RNs consider  consulting  with  their  legal  counsel  if  there  is  confusion  or  concern regarding their legal responsibilities and risks in the delegation.

## Education

Delegation is a skill that must be taught and practiced for nurses to be proficient in using it in the delivery of nursing care. It is a process that involves professional development and the application of critical thinking, and it improves with education and experience.

Delegation skills are learned and developed over time. The MAS RN assumes personal accountability for developing critical thinking skills. This personal accountability is consistent with ANA's foundational documents, the Code of Ethics for Nurses with Interpretive Statements (2001), Nursing's Social Policy Statement, Second Edition (2003), and the Nursing Scope and Standards of Practice (2003).

- Eight steps for self-appraisal of critical thinking skills to support accountability include the following:
1. Reflect on the way in which you think and review those steps you most often miss.
2. Learn from your mistakes and the mistakes of others.
3. Recognize personal indicators that warn you that your thinking ability may be less than optimal, such as illness, short staffing, or stress at home that reduces focus on work issues.
4. Participate in or lead discussions of clinical scenarios.
5. Participate in a mentorship or preceptor program, either as a participant or as a mentor or preceptor.
6. Develop an individual educational plan based on what you have learned or identified as strengths and educational needs from reflection and feedback.
7. Trust your intuition or the immediate apprehension that something is wrong without the benefit of conscious reasoning.
8. Use a model for creative thinking and problem-solving to habituate step-by-step critical processes.
- MAS Nurses are educated and mentored on how to delegate and supervise others effectively, including giving and receiving feedback.
- Nurse educators are encouraged to provide programs that include the principles for delegation and address areas for needed improvement.
- The guidelines related to delegation include the rules of delegation, the law, the profession's position on delegation, communication issues related to the MAS RN and the person, as well as the significant professional, legal, and ethical responsibilities and liabilities inherent in roles in which delegation is significant.

## Care Provisions

Elements essential for effective delegation include the following:

1. Emphasis on professional nursing practice.
2. Definition of delegation based on the Nurse Practice Act and regulations.
3. Review of specific sections of the law and regulations regarding delegation and identification of disciplinary actions related to inappropriate delegation.
4. Emphasis on tasks/functions that cannot be delegated.
5. Focus on MAS RN judgment for task analysis and decision to delegate.
6. Determination of the degree of supervision required for delegation.
7. Identification of guidelines for lowering risk related to delegation.
8. Development of feedback mechanisms to ensure that the task is completed and to receive updated data to evaluate the outcome.

Consistent with the Code of Ethics for Nurses with Interpretive Statements (ANA, 2001 ), the nurse must not engage in practices prohibited by law or delegated to others, activities prohibited by practice acts of other health care personnel, or other laws. MAS RNs determine the scope of their practice by considering their education, knowledge, competence, and extent of experience. The MAS RN is frequently called upon to carry out components of care delegated by other health care professionals as part of the person's treatment regime. When accepting a delegated assignment from another healthcare professional, if the MAS RN concludes that he/she is inadequately prepared to carry out a specific function, the MAS RN has the responsibility to refuse that work and to seek alternative sources for care based on concern for the person's welfare. In that refusal, both the person and the MAS RN are protected, because the MAS RN is accountable for the continuous care of persons in health care settings. The MAS RN does not accept delegation of interdependent functions if they are so extensive as to prevent the MAS RN from fulfilling the responsibility to provide appropriate nursing care to persons (ANA 1995).

## Steps of the Delegation Process

- Assess and plan the delegation, based on the person's needs and available resources.
- Communicate directions to the delegate including any unique personal requirements and characteristics as well as clear expectations regarding what to do, what to report, and when to ask for assistance.
- Surveillance and Supervision of the delegation, including the level of supervision needed for the situation and the implementation of that supervision, including follow-up to problems or a changing situation.
- Evaluation and Feedback to consider the effectiveness of the delegation, including any need to adjust the plan of care.

Delegation skills are developed over time. Nursing employers need to recognize that a newly licensed nurse is a novice who is still acquiring foundational knowledge and skills. In addition, many nurses lack the knowledge, skills, and confidence to delegate effectively, so ongoing opportunities to enforce the theory and apply the principles of delegation to essential parts of employee orientation and staff development.

Many nurses are reluctant to delegate. There are many contributing factors, ranging from not having had educational opportunities to lea how to work with others effectively, not knowing the skill level and abilities of nursing assistive personnel (MAC Workers), the work pace, and turnover of persons. At the same time, there has been an increase in the complexity of the nursing tasks performed by assistive personnel. With the demographic changes and increasing need for nursing services, plus the nursing shortage, nurses need the support of nursing assistive personnel.

## Reasons for the Nurse Delegation System

Delegation programs occur because there are inadequate numbers of nursing professionals to administer every medication to every person in programs certified by the ADMH. The Federal Olmstead regulations required States to offer disabled individuals services in the least restrictive environment. The Nurse Delegation Program (NDP) prevents the institutionalization of persons with mental disorders. The NDP allows persons with mental disorders to receive services in small, home-like environments, with nurse extenders (MAC Workers) who assist the MAS Nurses to provide adequate care to the persons served. The NDP does not diminish the value of nurses or dilute the importance of their professional judgment. The Alabama Nurse Practice Act states:

' The MAS RN/MAS LPN who provides care in residential community mental health programs certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health is accountable and responsible for the nursing care delivered to patients in those settings.' [ABN Regulation 610-X-7-.06(1)]

## Nurses' Liability

Liability continues to be an issue in all aspects of healthcare. Any healthcare professional can be sued under any circumstance when a perceived or real adverse event occurs.

The NDP clearly defines an acceptable community standard of care. The Alabama Nurse Practice Act states:

'The MAS RN/MAS LPN shall delegate only after considering various factors including but not limited to

- (a) Knowledge, skills, and experience of the person receiving the delegation.
- (b) Complexity of the delegated tasks.
- (c) Tasks delegated to unlicensed assistive personnel may not include tasks that require
- (a) The exercise of independent nursing judgment or intervention.
- (b) Invasive or sterile procedures.
- (c) The assistance of medication

## EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN CHAPTER 610-X-7 [ABN Regulation 610-X-6-.11(3)]'.

The NDP requires the MAS RN/MAS LPN to train and select appropriate unlicensed persons to delegate specific nursing tasks, provide ongoing supervision of the unlicensed person, and monitoring of the tasks delegated.

## IF IT'S NOT DOCUMENTED, IT WAS NOT DONE!

## Nurses may be sanctioned by the ABN for:

- Noncompliance with the Alabama Nurse Practice Act. (ABN REGULATIONS 610-X-6.03(1)-(9) and 610-X-7-.06(1)-(9)
- Lack of required documentation . ABN REGULATION 610-X-6-.06
- Lack of supervision of MAC Workers . (Direct Supervision: ABN REGULATION 610-X-2-

.06(19) The responsible licensed nurse is physically present in the facility and readily accessible to designate or prescribe a course of action or to give procedural guidance, direction, and periodic evaluation. Indirect Supervision: ABN REGULATION 610-X-2-.06(20) A MAS Nurse shall be available for inspection and evaluation through physical presence, and electronic or telephonic communication for direction, consultation, and collaboration).

## MAC Workers are responsible and accountable for their actions based on the documented  training  and  supervision  they  receive  from  the  delegating  MAS Nurse.

Community Providers certified by ADMH are responsible for assuring compliance with the NDP and that there are a sufficient number of staff to provide services based on the needs of the persons served. ADMH Certified Providers are responsible for assuring that a sufficient number of MAS RN/MAS LPNs are available to supervise MAC Workers 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. It is expected that important decisions about personal nursing care or changes in a person's status are addressed by a MAS RN/MAS LPN.

## Safeguards in the NDP

The MAS Nurse who signs the delegation form, delegating authority to a MAC Worker has the power to certify and decertify the MAC Worker.

' The MAS RN/MAS LPN delegating the task may at any time suspend or withdraw the delegation of specific tasks to a mental health worker'

## [ABN Regulation 610-X-7-.06(8)]

The decertified MAC Worker is not terminated from employment by the nurse but rather the agency management determines whether to continue employment. Under most circumstances, the MAS Nurse does not employ the MAC Worker but specifies that the unlicensed person can manage the delegated responsibilities. MAC Workers should not receive delegated authority because the facility lacks adequate manpower to meet the service requirements. The MAC Worker can only receive delegation authority when a MAS Nurse has determined that he/she can meet the professional standards of a MAC Worker. Any violation of the practice should be reported to the certifying Division and/or NDP Office of the ADMH.

A decertification decision must be carefully documented. Decertification can occur based on the occurrences of a breach in the NDP guidelines, the occurrence of Level 2 or Level 3 medication errors, or repeated minor violations that suggest the lack of professionalism and competency of the MAC Worker. A major deficiency in any of the quality domains of competency, documentation, error reporting, identification of the 7 rights of assisting with medications, professionalism, reliability, and respect, may be sufficient for temporary or permanent decertification. Intentional falsification of documentation is a very serious event and warrants consideration for decertification. Ultimately, all decertification decisions depend on the best judgment of the MAS Nurse. The Agency Administration cannot override the MAS Nurse to reinstate the MAC Worker who has been decertified by a MAS Nurse.

Some MAS Nurses will supervise many MAC Workers. The documentation of direct supervision assures the MAC Workers have regular monitoring. Problems with a MAC Worker must be immediately reported to and addressed by the MAS Nurse who is delegating to the MAC Worker.

The NDP does not specify the ratio of MAS Nurses to MAC Workers because this decision is best made by the individual MAS Nurse. The MAS Nurse should not be compelled to supervise more MAC Workers than the MAS Nurse can safely manage.

## SECTION 4

## Introduction to the Nurse Delegation Program

## NOTES TO MAS NURSE

The Nurse Delegation Program is a NURSE DRIVEN program. The unlicensed workers, called MAC Workers, are extenders, not replacements, of the nurse. All skilled tasks must be completed by licensed nurses and documented accordingly.

## The Nurse Delegation Program

- This program is the exception to the Nurse Practice Act that allows properly trained nurses, employed by agencies certified by ADMH to delegate selected nursing tasks to trained unlicensed personnel.
- The NDP provides information to the licensed and unlicensed workforce in mental health community programs regarding mental and physical disorders, as well as preventive healthcare.
- The NDP is utilized by people with mental disorders living and working in the community.
- The NDP focuses on safety by assuring that people served who are unable to self-medicate in community programs receive their medications safely and effectively.
- The NDP focuses on safety by creating a system to maximize accuracy and reduce the likelihood of medication administration errors.
- This manual is designed to assist the medication administration supervising (MAS) nurse in understanding the responsibility of delegation, training, and verifying competency of all nursing tasks delegated to unlicensed personnel.
- This manual complements the MAC I computer training and provides guidance on the following:
- o educational expectations
- o documentation
- o nurses' liability

## The components of the NDP are as follows:

Organizational Responsibilities

Education and Training

Quality Assurance

Compliance

- Goals of the NDP are as follows:
1.    Provide safe and accurate assistance with medication administration.
2. Provide  safe  and  effective  nursing  care  to  persons  served  in  ADMH Community Programs.

## SECTION 5 Alabama Law

## NOTES TO MAS NURSE

Every nurse licensed in Alabama is required to practice in compliance with the Nurse Practice Act regardless of the location of your nursing practice (hospital, homecare, office, community). The second most common reason nurses are sanctioned by the ABN is non-compliance with the Nurse Practice Act. MAS nurses are strongly encouraged to read and review the Nurse Practice Act at least annually and as needed.

## IF YOU WOULD NOT DO IT IN THE HOSPITAL; DO NOT DO IT IN THE COMMUNITY.

IF YOU, DID IT IN THE HOSPITAL; YOU NEED TO DO IT IN THE COMMUNITY.

## UNDERSTANDING ALABAMA LAW

- The Nurse Delegation Program allows a non-licensed direct care worker in ADMH-certified Community Mental Health Programs to assist a MAS-trained nurse with medication administration.
- Alabama law limits the possession and distribution of medications to anyone other than the person prescribed the medications.
- Family members may administer medications to children or adults who are direct blood relatives. Administration of medications by family members in ADMH-certified programs is not encouraged due to the increase in liability; however, the agency's board-approved policies and procedures should be followed as it relates to family members administering medications in ADMH-certified programs.
- Persons unrelated and non-licensed are not allowed to give medicines to other individuals as part of their job function in the State of Alabama.
- Alabama law requires that a registered nurse (MAS RN) directs the care of the licensed practical nurse (MAS LPN). The MAS RN directs the care of the MAC Worker.
- The MAS RN and/or MAS LPN may train and supervise a MAC Worker.

The Medication Assistant Certified (MAC) Worker serves as an assistant to our licensed nursing professionals.

One of the MAC worker's primary responsibilities is to communicate with a MAS Nurse and give accurate information about the person's status.

The regulation that forms the foundation for the Nurse Delegation Program is found in the Alabama Board of Nursing Administrative Code, Regulation 610-X-7-.06

According to Regulation 610-X-7-.06 Alabama Department of Mental Health Residential Community Programs,

- o The registered nurse or licensed practical nurse who provides care in residential community mental health programs certified by the Alabama Department of Mental Health is accountable and responsible for the nursing care delivered to patients in those settings.
- o Registered nurses or licensed practical nurses who provide nursing care in the residential community mental health setting, and the community extensions including day habilitation programs may delegate specific limited tasks to designated unlicensed assistive personnel.

- o The Registered Nurse is responsible and accountable for the completion of a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of the patient's nursing care needs.
- o A The MAS LPN may initiate and document data elements of the comprehensive assessment. The outcome of the comprehensive assessment determines the tasks that may be safely performed by unlicensed assistive personnel in residential community mental health settings.
- o The specific delegated tasks shall not require the exercise of independent nursing judgment or intervention. Specific tasks that require independent nursing judgment or intervention that shall not be delegated include, but are not limited to, the following:

## SECTION 7

## Implementation of the Nurse Delegation Program

## NOTES TO MAS NURSE

## 'MAS RN ONLY' Functions:

1. Completion of a comprehensive assessment of all people served
2. Completion of the nursing care plan
3. Supervision of MAS LPNs

## These functions are mandated by the following ABN Regulations:

- ABN Regulation 610-X-7-.06(3)

The MAS Registered Nurse is responsible and accountable for the completion of a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of the patient's nursing care needs. The MAS LPN may initiate and document data elements of the comprehensive assessment. The outcome of the comprehensive assessment determines  the tasks that may be safely performed by unlicensed assistive personnel in residential community mental health settings.

- ABN Regulation 610-X-2-.06(2) Assessment, Comprehensive The systematic collection and ANALYSIS of data including the physical, psychological, social, cultural, and spiritual aspects of the patient by the MAS RN for the purpose of judging a patient's health and illness status and actual or potential health needs.

THE ADMISSION ASSESSMENT Shall BE COMPLETED WITHIN 72 hours. It shall have a complete care plan, signed and in the clinical chart within TEN (10) DAYS OF ADMISSION.

## The PRN AND/OR STATUS CHANGE ASSESSMENTS Shall BE initiated WITHIN 24 hours and signed in the clinical record within five days.

· ABN Regulation 610-X-6-.05(1) (e) Practice of Practical Nursing The practice of practical nursing includes but is not limited to conducting and documenting data elements of the comprehensive assessment.

- ABN Regulation 610-X-6-.05(1)(g) Practice of practical nursing

The practice of practical nursing includes, but is not limited to the provision of care UNDER the direction of a MAS RN, MD, or dentist who considers the following elements:

- (i) Evaluation of knowledge, skills, and experience of the MAS LPN
- (ii) Complexity of the assigned tasks
- (iii) Health status of the patient

## NDP IMPLEMENTATION TREE

(GO TO STEP 2)

THE Standards of Nursing

(STOP)

## STEP ONE: MAS RN Assessment

## STEP TWO: MAS RN/LPN

<!-- image -->

## REMEMBER 5 RIGHTS OF DELEGATION

- Right task(s)
- Right circumstance
- Right person
- Right directions and communication
- Right supervision and evaluations

## The Nurse Delegation Program is implemented the same way in every program certified by ADMH.

The first step of the Nurse Delegation Program is the MAS RN Comprehensive Assessment to be completed within 72 hours, plan of care completed, signed, and in the medical record within 10 days of admission of the person's needs. This assessment can be initiated by the MAS LPN. The purpose of the assessment is to determine if the needs of the person can be safely provided for by a MAC Worker OR if the person's needs are too complicated and require skilled nursing to safely meet their needs.

Once the MAS LPN has initiated the comprehensive assessment, the MAS RN must review and summarize the needs of the person. The document is not complete without the MAS RN's signature, credentials, and date. The MAS RN completes ALL nursing care plans. The MAS RN/LPN must communicate assessment findings and planned interventions to the treatment/interdisciplinary team, and especially to other delegating nurse(s) and MAC Worker(s). The MAS RN assessment must be completed:

- Initially (completed within 72 hours, plan of care completed, signed and in the medical record within 10 days of admission)
- Any time there is a change in the person's status (initiated within 24 hours and plan of care updated, signed and in clinical record within 5 days of status change)
- Updated at least annually

Nursing Care Plans are updated by the MAS RN when the MAS RN assessment is Updated (change of status and annually). The MAS RN Assessment and Nursing Care Plans shall be part of the clinical record.

The second step of the Nurse Delegation Program is the MAS Nurse (RN/LPN) assessment of the person's ability to self-medicate. Criteria for the person who can self-medicate ,

- The person can effectively verbalize understanding of the purpose of the medication(s)
- The person can effectively verbalize common possible side effects , including:
- i.  What to do if a dose is missed
- ii.  What to do if extra dose(s) taken
- iii.  What to do if adverse reactions occur
- The person can recognize the medication(s)
- Verbalize/demonstrate the steps of administration to include the correct med, time, and use of PRN medication, documentation
- The person can perform a medication return demonstration, securing medication correctly.

Self-medicators are not required to have approval from the MAS nurse prior to PRN medication. All other NDP guidelines apply for self-medicators - meds must be locked/doublelocked as required.

- Self-medication observation records (SMOR, SMAR, or MAR) must be documented.
- There must be written accountability for ALL medication.
- MAC Worker must contact the MAS Nurse if there are any concerns or problems.

Example: PRN Tylenol 325mg 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours for complaints of headache. The Nurse would only want to put enough Tylenol in the medication area for a couple of days. The nurse would have a count of how many are put in the med area and review the number of PRNs taken for accuracy. If the person served does not take PRNs according to the prescriber's orders, then he/she cannot fully self-medicate.

For persons who partially self-medicate or cannot self-medicate , the MAC Worker must contact the MAS Nurse before assisting with all PRN medications.

The assessment of a person's ability to self-medicate must be done initially, any time there is a change in a person's status, and at least annually. There must be documentation in the person's medical record of the completed assessment.

The family, person, nor the Agency have the right to demand self-medication when assessment by a MAS Nurse (RN/LPN) determines the person does not meet the criteria to self-medicate.

## Pill Planners, Pill Boxes, and Medication Dispensers

A licensed nurse may sit with a person who is capable of self-medication administration while the person fills his/her pill box (this oversite cannot be delegated to a MAC Worker). The medications must be removed from the medication bottle/package and placed into the pill box by the person. The nurse is NOT allowed to pre-fill the pill box for the person. The MAS Nurse may NOT package or repackage medications, this includes selfmedication dispensers. ALL medications must be locked (double locked for controlled) and stored in a safe and secure area to ensure there is no unauthorized access.

***A MAC Worker may assist the person who can self-medicate by reminding him/her of medication times, but the person must administer the meds themselves.

## Emergency Medications

Emergency medications prescribed for a person such as asthma inhalers, Epi-pens or nitroglycerine, etc. must be kept wherever the person receives services. The Agency is required to have a policy that addresses emergency medications, including who educates the MAC worker, who obtains medication, and who is responsible for checking the availability of the medication (For example the MAS Nurse assigned to the service area). The MAS Nurse must be contacted any time emergency medications are used. ALL medications are locked, and controlled medications are double-locked.

## SECTION 8

## The MAS-MAC Connection

## * ABN Regulation 610-X-2-.06(5) Assignment, Unlicensed Individual

The designation of tasks from a licensed nurse to unlicensed assistive personnel (MAC Workers) The licensed nurse making the assignment retains accountability for accurate and timely completion and outcome of the tasks.

*ABN Regulation 610-x-(19) Supervision, Direct: Responsible licensed nurse physically present in the facility and readily accessible to designate or prescribe a course of action or to give procedural guidance, direction, and periodic evaluation. Direct supervision by a registered nurse is required for new graduates practicing on a temporary permit.

## * ABN Regulation 610-X-2-.20 Supervision, Indirect

A responsible licensed nurse is AVAILABLE for periodic inspection and evaluation through physical presence and, electronic or telephonic communication for direction, consultation, and collaboration.

## NOTES TO MAS NURSE

## ABN Regulation 610-X-6-.03 Conduct and Accountability

The RN or LPN shall:

- Be responsible for monitoring and evaluating the quality of patient care delivered by personnel under the individual nurse's supervision.
- Be responsible and accountable for the delegation of selected nursing activities in selected situations to unlicensed individuals.

{The licensed nurse retains accountability for the accurate and timely completion of tasks delegated to unlicensed assistive personnel (MAC Workers).}

## ABN Regulation 610-X-6-.11 Assignment, Delegation, and Supervision

- The licensed nurse shall delegate only after considering various factors, including but not limited to:
- (a) Knowledge, skills, and experience of the person receiving the delegation.
- (b) Complexity of the delegated task.
- (c) Health Status of the patient.
- Supervision shall be provided to individuals to whom nursing functions or responsibilities are delegated or assigned.

{The responsible licensed nurse is AVAILABLE for periodic inspection and evaluation through physical presence and/or electronic or telephonic communication for direction, consultation, and collaboration.}

## ABN Regulation 610-X-7-.06 Alabama Department of Mental Health Residential Community Programs.

- The specific delegated tasks shall not require the exercise of independent nursing judgment or intervention.

## The MAS-MAC Connection

## DELEGATING NURSES MUST BE AVAILABLE AND MUST RESPOND PROMPTLY (15 -30 MINUTES) TO ALL CALLS FROM MAC WORKERS.

The On-Call Nurse must be MAS trained with a current MAS Certification.

The On-Call MAS Nurse does not have to be the MAS Nurse who trained the MAC worker. The On-Call MAS Nurse may delegate to the Unlicensed MAC Worker.  Since all MAC Workers and MAS Nurses receive the same training, there will be consistency with the MAS-MAC Connection.

## What is the MAS-MAC Connection?

- The MAC Worker is an extension of the MAS Nurse.
- The MAS Nurse is responsible and accountable for nursing care provided by ADMH Nurse Delegation Certified Programs.
- The MAS Nurse is the knowledge base for the MAC Worker while the MAC Worker is the

eyes, ears, hands, and voice of the MAS Nurse.

- The MAC Worker and the MAS Nurse have a symbiotic (mutually beneficial) relationship -

each one needs the other.

<!-- image -->

REMEMBER -ABN Regulation 610-X-7-.06 (1) Alabama Department of Mental Health Residential Community Programs:

The MAS RN/LPN who provides care in residential mental health programs certified by the ADMH is accountable and responsible for nursing care delivered to residents in those settings .

- The persons served by the agency are patients of the MAS Nurse.  This is comparable to a Nurse/Patient Assignment in a hospital setting. The nurse is required by the Nurse Practice Act to be responsible and accountable for nursing care .
- The MAC Worker shall have access to a MAS Nurse via physical presence, electronic or telephonic twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week without exception.
- The MAS Nurse shall include information regarding how to contact him/her AND what to do if there is no response within 30 minutes.  Contact Information and instructions shall be available to the MAC Worker.

· A MAS Nurse shall be available to the MAC Worker 24/7.  The MAS Nurse needs to take calls only during the time he/she can be available for indirect and, if necessary, direct supervision of the MAC Workers.  This is a right of the MAC Worker and a responsibility of the MAS Nurse.

## SECTION 10

## Medication Errors

## NOTES TO MAS NURSE

All Medication errors by licensed and unlicensed staff must be reported to the ADMH in accordance with the Division's Guidelines .

## Medication Errors

Medication errors would include any mistake with the 7 Rights of medication administration. ABN Regulation 610-X-6-.07(1) (j) (i-vii) Medication Administration and Safety state:

The MAS RN/MAS LPN shall have applied knowledge of medication administration and safety, including safety precautions but not limited to:

- (i) Right patient
- (ii) Right medications
- (iii) Right time
- (iv) Right dose
- (v) Right route
- (vi) Right reason
- (vii) Right documentation

## ALL MEDICATION ERRORS COMMITTED BY LICENSED &amp; UNLICENSED PERSONS SHALL BE REPORTED IN THE ADMH INCIDENT PREVENTION &amp; MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

## Medication Errors are entered into IPMS by TYPE:

Many medications are prescribed for use other than FDA classification. A 'wrong reason' medication error occurs when a medication is administered for a reason other than prescribed.

- Example #1: Benadryl prescribed for allergy relief cannot be used as a sleep agent. Unless a separate order is obtained from a legally authorized prescriber.
- Example #2: Depakote prescribed for seizures cannot be used as a mood stabilizer. Unless a separate order is obtained from a legally authorized prescriber.
- Example #3: Lorazepam prescribed (PRN) as a pre-sedation medication cannot be used as a chemical restraint for behavioral issues. Unless a separate order is obtained from a legally authorized prescriber.

Forgetting to give a dose of medication is called a 'missed dose'. This is also a medication error.

A 'wrong person' medication error is when someone is administered medication prescribed for another person.

A 'wrong medication' error is when a medication is given that has been discontinued, contaminated, expired, or is listed as an allergy.

A 'wrong time' error occurs when the medication is given outside of the window of administration time (one hour before/one hour after MAR time).

A 'wrong dose' medication error is when a person receives more or less than the prescribed order.

## The severity of medication errors is noted in Levels - I, II, and  III.

Level I medication errors are called 'monitoring errors' . A Level I error is an incident in which the person experienced no or minimal adverse consequences AND no treatment or intervention other than monitoring or observation within the agency is required. Lack of appropriate documentation on the MAR after medication administration is a Level I medication error.

A Level II medication error is called a 'treatment error'. A Level II medication error is an incident in which the person experienced short-term, reversible adverse consequences AND treatment or intervention in addition to monitoring is required. Sending a person to the emergency room, urgent care, or unscheduled Primary care physician in response to a medication error is a Level II medication error. An evaluation from a health care professional outside the agency.

A Level III medication error is a sentinel (serious) event . A Level III medication error is an incident in which the person experienced life-threatening and/or permanent adverse consequences (loss of bodily function). Hospital admission in response to a medication error is a Level III medication error.

The delegating MAS Nurse must be notified immediately of ALL medication errors upon discovery.

The NDP Coordinator is notified of Level II and III  medication errors within 24 hours.

The Divisional Incident Prevention and Management Policies and Procedures are used to guide the MAS Nurse/Agency Administrator in reporting medication errors to ADMH. Medication errors must be included in the agency's Quality Assurance Plan, which will be reviewed during the Agency's Certification Survey.

Medication administration errors by different types of healthcare professionals including physicians, pharmacists, MAS RNs, and MAS LPNs, occur regularly in all clinical settings. A medication error does not necessarily constitute negligent care. Successful lawsuits occur when healthcare professionals violate the community standard of care and do not adhere to basic practices.

Each medication error must be evaluated on its merit. The occurrence of a medication error does not imply the MAC Worker or licensed professional is incompetent or negligent.

Repeated medication errors despite re-education or flagrant, reckless behavior that causes risk to persons require immediate action for correction or revocation of MAC privileges. The MAS RN/MAS LPN HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DE-CERTIFY a MAC Worker.

The Agency Administrator/designee and the MAS Nurse must assess all Level II and Level III Medication errors within 24 hours of the discovery of the error.

MAC Certification is suspended for all Level II &amp; III errors until the MAS Nurse has determined that the MAC Worker can resume MAC responsibilities OR the MAC Worker is decertified.

All Staff who input medication errors into the IMPS are required to know the TYPES and Levels of MEDICATION ERRORS.

Anytime there is a medication error other than a documentation error , the MAC worker is trained using the NDP 21 Medication Error Training Form .

## NOTES TO MAS NURSE

ADMH Certification Surveyors will be looking for the standardized NDP Forms noted. At agencies where electronic medical records are in place and the NDP Forms cannot be mirrored, the agency must have a policy and procedure approved by the agency's Board of Directors that notes the approved form(s) and how it will be used.

## NOTE:  ID/MH/SUD COMPREHENSIVE AGENCIES

NDP is the same for all Divisions. Each Division has specific operational guidelines that must be assessed by certification surveyors IN ADDITION TO the NDP score sheet . Those specifics by Divisions could impact the agency score.

## The Delegation Form (NDP-2)

Delegation is a legal action that is not official until the delegation form is signed by the MAC Worker and the delegating MAS Nurse(s).

## Completing the MAC Training IS NOT delegation

Every MAC Worker must have a delegation form. The MAC Worker must sign the form acknowledging completion of the Alabama Board of Nursing approve MAC I and MAC II training AND the willingness to accept the responsibility to assist with medication administration and other delegated nursing tasks.

The delegating MAS Nurse is responsible for the supervision of the MAC Worker and the nursing care provided in ALL ADMH Certified Community Programs

The date the MAC Worker completed MAC I is documented in the required space.

Column 1 : 'DATE MAC II COMPLETED', is the date the delegating MAS Nurse verifies the successful completion of eight (8) hours of MAC II training and the date of verification of competency of all delegated nursing tasks on the skills checklist.

Column 2 , 'DATE DELEGATION SUSPENDED', is the date the MAC Worker's delegation privileges are stopped for a brief period (temporary). The MAS Nurse must document the reason for the suspension and the planned corrective action in the 'comments/notes' section on the back of the delegation form. Suspensions should be documented on MAC Direct Annual Supervision Form.

Column 3: This contains the date delegation begins.

Column 4: MAS Nurse signature, credentials, and date.

By signing this form, the MAS Nurse has acknowledged that the MAC Worker has satisfactorily completed the MAC II training and Skills competency checklist. The MAS Nurse signs and dates each time action, i.e., successful completion of MAC II or redelegation after suspension of delegation duties.

## ABN Regulation 610-X-6-.11(3) Assignment, Delegation, and Supervision state:

'The MAS RN/MAS LPN shall delegate only after considering various factors including but not limited to:

- (a) Knowledge, skills, and experience of the person receiving the delegation
- (b) Complexity of the delegated tasks
- (c) Health status of the patient'

The delegation form must be maintained in the active MAC Worker file throughout the duration of the delegation.

All MAC Workers must have (4) hours of recertification/update training performed by a MAS Nurse with a current certificate. The 4-hour recertification covers the agency's policy and procedures related to NDP and a review of all delegated tasks at a minimum every two (2) years.

When a MAS Nurse begins to work at an agency where another MAS Nurse was previously the delegating nurse , the new MAS Nurse must verify the following:

## ALL MAS Nurses must verify the following prior to signing the delegation form:

- MAC Worker has an HS diploma/GED/College Transcript
- Successful completion of MAC I as evidenced by certificates (note date on delegation form)
- Successful completion of eight (8) hours of MAC II as evidenced by a certificate signed by a MAS Nurse (If the certificate is not available, the MAS Nurse must teach 8 hours of MAC II)

Competency of the MAC Worker to perform all nursing tasks delegated as indicated by completion of the Skills Checklist (date must be noted on delegation form).

The date noted on the NDP skills checklist is the date that must be documented on the delegation form.

When there is a team of Delegating Nurses at an agency, the New MAS Nurse/s may use their nursing judgment to determine if the training/competency verification done by other MAS nurses is adequate. The NEW MAS NURSE MUST DOCUMENT that they have accepted the delegation by signing the Delegation form.

.

## REVOCATION/DECERTIFICATION OF DELEGATION ( NDP 15) THIS FORM HAS TWO PURPOSES:

The first is when delegation privileges are permanently revoked, a 'Revocation/Decertification of Delegation Form, NDP 15, must be completed by the MAS Nurse.

- A copy should be placed in the MAC Worker file
- If this action occurs, it should be documented on the Delegation form and Supervision form as well

When a MAS Nurse leaves an agency where he/she has been the delegating nurse, as evidenced by his/her signature on the delegation form, revocation of the MAC Worker /s privileges may be documented on the letter of resignation. The professional letter of resignation, including the revocation of MAC Worker/s, shall be maintained in the MAS Nurse's personnel file.

OR the MAS Nurse may complete the Revocation/Decertification form and list (attach a list) of the MAC WORKERS

NDP personnel files shall be maintained for as long as the employee is active in the agency.

Inactive files shall be maintained for a minimum of five years.

## MAC Annual Direct Supervision Form (NDP-3)

This form is used to document direct supervision ( face-to-face ) of MAC Workers by the MAS RN/MAS LPN. ABN regulation 610-X-2-.06(19), 'Supervision, Direct' states: ' Responsible licensed nurse physically present in the facility and readily accessible to designate or prescribe a course of action or to give procedural guidance, direction, and periodic evaluation.'

- The MAS Nurse must provide direct supervision, face-to-face, at least annually and/or PRN.
- The direct supervision form has a 90-day grace period.
- Direct supervision will be documented as needed, in addition to the annual requirement (Retraining, reprimand, suspension, and decertification)
- The rating scale ranges from '1' - very poor, to '5' - outstanding. A '1' or '5' rating must be accompanied by comments documented by the MAS Nurse.
- o REMEMBER: A SCORE OF 1 REQUIRES A PLAN TO ASSIST THE MAC WORKER ACHIEVE COMPETENCY
- The MAS Nurse and the MAC Worker must discuss the evaluation, and sign, and date the form.

## MAS RN Assessment (NDP 8)

NDP 8 is an optional form. The MAS RN Comprehensive assessment is NOT optional. It is REQUIRED. Agencies may use their assessment as long as it contains the same information as NDP 8. ABN Regulation 610-X-7-.06 ADMH Residential Community Programs states:

' The MAS RN is accountable for determining the tasks that may be safely performed by the unlicensed assistive personnel in residential community mental health settings following appropriate training and demonstration of competency.'

The method used by a MAS RN to make this determination is the performance of a comprehensive assessment as defined by ABN Regulation 610-X-2-.06(2):

'the systematic collection and analysis of data including the physical, psychological, social, cultural and spiritual aspects of the patient by the MAS RN to judge a patient's health and illness status and actual or potential health needs.

The comprehensive assessment includes patient history, physical examination, analysis of the data collected, and development of the patient plan of care, implementation, and evaluation of the plan of care.'

The agency and/or MAS RN may use a form of choice as directed by the agency's policies and procedures to document the required elements of the Comprehensive Assessment. The MAS RN Assessment form NDP 8 was developed to meet the elements required by the ABN regulation.

The ABN regulations governing the Practice of Practical Nursing (Practice), 610-X-6.05(1) (e) states:

'The practice of practical nursing includes but is not limited to conducting and documenting data elements of the comprehensive assessment.'

This allows the MAS LPN to assist the MAS RN in the comprehensive assessment by the completion of pages 1-6 of form NDP 8. The MAS LPN must sign and date at the noted place on  the  form.  The  MAS  RN  shall  complete  the  systems  review  as  evidenced  by  his/her signature/date/credentials noted on the form.

## SECTION 13

## Principles of First Aid

## NOTES TO THE MAS NURSE

## The MAS Nurse must cover the following information in ALL MAC II Training .

## First Aid

First Aid is used in emergencies - falls, accidents, injuries, etc. The performance of First Aid does not require an order from a legally authorized prescriber.

The contents of First Aid kits are approved by the MAS RN/MAS LPN. No items included in the First Aid kits are considered PRN medications. OTC and PRN medications are required to have a prescriber's order and are not included in the First Aid Kit.  The First Aid Kit shall be always accessible to the MAC Workers.  Any item in the First Aid kit, including  triple antibiotic ointments (TAO) and/or anti-itch creams, may be used by the MAC Worker as directed by the MAS Nurse during First Aid training. Remind the MAC Worker to always check the person's allergies . In the case of First Aid the MAC should care for the person first, then call the MAS Nurse.

Anytime First Aid is used, some incident has caused a change in the status of the person. The MAC Worker should report all changes in person status to the MAS Nurse and document the communication according to NDP guidelines and agency policies and procedures.

Items you may see in the First Aid Kit

- Gauze
- Alcohol preps/Antiseptics
- Band-aid
- Antibiotic ointment
- Anti-itch cream
- Medical Tape
- Gloves

NOTE: Any ointments, creams, or liquids opened will expire in 30 days, therefore it must be dated when opened, discarded after 30 days, and replaced.

## Personal Care vs. Treatments

Treatments are ordered by a legally authorized prescriber to address a specific problem. It is best practice to transcribe treatments to the MAR and to document completion as ordered.

Personal care does not require an order from a legally authorized prescriber and is usually a personal preference or comfort measure .

## Example #1: Head and Shoulders Shampoo

- Treatment:  Dr. Smith ordered Susie; Head and Shoulders shampoo every other day for excessive dandruff and scalp itching.
- Personal Care: Susie Sunshine uses head and shoulder shampoo every day because she likes the way it makes her hair feel.

## Example #2: Sunscreen

- Treatment:  Dr. Smith ordered to apply sunscreen to Joe before going outside due to skin sensitivity.
- Personal Care: Joe uses sunscreen before going outside because he heard it helps protect him from skin problems.
- Treatment: Dr. Smith ordered to apply of Baza cream to Jenny's buttocks after each incontinent episode.
- Personal Care: Apply Destin (or preferred moisture barrier) to Jenny's buttocks after each incontinent episode.

## Example #3: Skin Barrier

## Treatments ARE documented on the MAR.

Personal Care is not required to be documented on the MAR.

## Follow the MAC II PowerPoint to cover at a minimum:

First Aid and Emergency Management are part of all MAC trainings by the MAS Nurse (initial and update)

- When to call '911'
- Common First Aid Situations and how to handle them at your Agency
- Agency's Emergency Management Plan
- Emergency Medications
- Seizures
- Choking
- Falls
- Cardiac Arrest

## The Red Cross intervention for choking

Don't perform the five-and-five method on a child. You should only give a child the Heimlich maneuver.

- Send someone to call 9-1-1
- Lean person forward and give 5 back blows with heel of your hand.
- Give 5 quick abdominal thrusts by placing the thumb side of your fist against the middle of the victim's abdomen, just above the navel. Grab your fist with the other hand.
- Repeat until the object the person is choking on is forced out and person breathes or coughs on his or her own.

## https://www.redcross.org/flash/brr/english-html/conscious-choking.asp

## Last updated: 1/24/2023

After removing the object that caused the choking, keep the person still and get medical help . Anyone who is choking should have a medical examination. Complications can occur not only from the choking, but also from the first aid measures that were taken.                                                                                                            Feb 12, 2021

https://medlineplus.gov › Medical Encyclopedia

The complications of choking include throat irritation, throat damage, and death from asphyxiation. After the Heimlich complications such as rib fracture, diaphragm rupture, pneumomediastinum, acute thrombosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm, mesenteric laceration, and traumatic injury of the gastrointestinal tract could occur.

Anyone who chokes in a ADMH certified agency and the MAC worker has to physically assist the person to dislodge the object shall be immediately follow up with a physician.

None contact intervention should be assessed by the MAS nurse

## SECTION 14

## Principles of Infection Control and Universal Precautions

## NOTES TO THE MAS NURSE

This information must be covered in MAC II Training. The MAS Nurse is expected to build on the following outline to include specifics mandated by the agency's policies and procedures and current CDC guidelines.

## Hand Washing

- Hand washing is the number one defense against the spread of disease and infection.
- Before assisting with any care MAC Workers and nurses should properly wash their hands.
- Hand washing protects both the person and the staff.

## Principles of Infection Control

- Infections are caused by germs.
- Germs are all around us, in us, on us, on animals, insects, and plants, in the soil and water.
- Most germs do not cause illness in healthy people; most of the illnesses caused are mild, i.e., the common cold.
- A communicable disease can be passed from one person to another.
- For a communicable or infectious disease to be passed from one person to another, four things must occur:
- o A germ must be present.
- o The germ must have a place to live and grow.
- o There must be a susceptible host.
- o There must be a way for the germ to enter the host.
- Removing any one of the four requirements for infection to spread breaks the chain of infection, thus preventing the infection from spreading.
- Once germs leave the body, they must travel from one person to another.
- Germs can travel by direct or indirect contact via
- o insects
- o animals
- o inanimate objects
- o water
- o food
- o air
- Direct contact is contact between the infected person and the non-infected person.
- Indirect contact is contact between the infected person and objects in the environment which became contaminated with the germ.
- Once the germ travels from one person to another, it must enter the body of the noninfected person via
- o swallowing
- o breathing in
- o injection
- o opening in the skin, i.e. cut or scratch

## Blood Borne Diseases

- HIV - Human Immunodeficiency Virus
- o causes AIDS
- o attacks the body's immune system
- HBV - Hepatitis B Virus
- o Infects the liver
- o May cause cirrhosis or liver cancer
- HCV - Hepatitis C
- o Viral liver infection
- o May have no or mild symptoms
- o Usually causes cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease

## Air Borne Infections

- SARS
- Flu
- TB
- Covid
- Viral Meningitis

## Contagious Skin Infections

- Scabies
- Bed Bugs
- Lice (Capitis/Pubis)
- Ringworm
- Athlete's Feet
- Shingles
- Bacterial Meningitis

## How to Break the Chain of Infection

- Look at your habits, lifestyles, and surroundings for things that may promote infection.
- Identify things in the infection chain that can be eliminated.

## SECTION 15

## Seizure Management

## NOTES TO THE MAS NURSE

This information must be covered in MAC II Training.

Review the agency's seizure management plan. Focus on keeping the persons safe.

## Seizures

- Seizure disorder is the same as epilepsy.
- Seizures are produced by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
- Seizures are usually distressing to the person and can be life-threatening.
- Antiseizure or anti-epileptic medications help prevent the abnormal firing of brain cells.
- Noncompliance with anti-epileptic medications is a common cause of recurrent seizures.
- Seizures commonly occur in persons with mental disorders.
- Some people know before they are about to have a seizure (aura). They may say 'I feel funny' or 'I smell something strange.'
- There are several types of seizures. Make staff aware of what type they may see in the agency.
- The best-known type of seizure is called a grand-mal seizure.

## Grand Mal Seizures

- May cause loss of consciousness.
- Causes loss of control of body muscles.
- Causes rhythmic jerking motions of the arms, legs, and body.
- May cause loss of bowel and/or bladder functions.
- May cause irregular breathing pattern

## MAC Worker Responsibilities

- Stay with the person .
- Protect the person's privacy.
- Protect the person from injury during a seizure.
- Observe the time started and ends.
- Never put your hands, fingers, or any object in the mouth of a person having a seizure.
- Call your MAS Nurse.
- Remove all potentially harmful objects.
- Protect the person's head from any injury.
- Do not hold any part of the person down.
- If possible, place a person on their side during a seizure: if not during then promptly after the seizure.
- A change in the number of seizures is important. Notify your MAS Nurse of any change in the number and/or intensity of seizures for a person.
- Non-compliance with seizure medication is a common reason people have more seizures. Notify your MAS Nurse any time a person is non-compliant with medications.
- A new onset seizure for persons who have no history of seizure is a medical emergency. Follow the agency's seizure protocol and call your MAS Nurse.

## Documentation of a Seizure

- Note and document the time the seizure begins and ends.
- Describe what occurred, what the person was doing, and what the person looked like.
- Document all information required by your agency's seizure management policies and procedures including the time you call your MAS Nurse.

## SECTION 16

## Indications and Usage for Naloxone Auto-Injector

Naloxone Auto-Injector is an opioid antagonist indicated for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression in adults and pediatric patients.

Naloxone Auto-Injector is intended for immediate administration as emergency therapy in settings where opioids may be present.

Naloxone Auto-Injector is not a substitute for emergency medical care.

## INFORMATION ON HOW TO ADMINISTER NALOXONE

Naloxone can be administered in a couple of different ways:

1. By spraying the medicine into the nose (intranasal or IN administration)
2. By auto-injector; a pre-filled, ready-to-use dose of the medication is administered simply by pressing the medicine against a person's upper leg (intramuscular or IM)
- (1) Naloxone administration via nasal spray (Luer-lock nasal atomizer):

- (2) Naloxone administration with the Evzio auto-injector:

On April 3, 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Evzio auto injector for nonclinical settings. This device is ready to use. A single dose of naloxone is administered with a retractable needle. Accidental needle sticks are avoided, and the device is easy to use. You do not have to fill a needle or attach a cartridge or nasal piece. It also has a voice recording that tells you step-by-step how to administer the naloxone. (Note: Make sure you push hard-until you hear the voice again- when the device is placed on the person's thigh)

*Exception: A 'trailing zero' may be used only where required to demonstrate the level of precision of the value being reported, such as for laboratory results, imaging studies that report the size of lesions, or catheter/tube sizes. It may not be used in medication orders or other medication-related documentation.

## Development of the 'Do Not Use' List

In 2001, The Joint Commission issued a Sentinel Event Alert on the subject of medical abbreviations. A year later, its Board of Commissioners approved a National Patient Safety Goal requiring accredited organizations to develop and implement a list of abbreviations not to use. In 2004, The Joint Commission created its 'Do Not Use' List to meet that goal. In 2010, NPSG.02.02.01 was integrated into the Information Management standards as elements of performance 2 and 3 under IM.02.02.01.               9/18
