KING left Treasures Island Motel in Mrs. WARD's automobile foy the purpose of going to memphis, Tennessee, to partisome of her clothing in kitchenette #4 at the Treasures Island motel as she planned to return to the motel after the march for urther vacationing. rs. DAVIs does not believe that the owner f the motel, the HASTINGS, knew at the time Mrg. DAVIS and he: companions left the potel that they were going to Memphis, but the HASTINGS did know that Mrs. WARD planned to returm in a few days to the motel.

Mrs. DAVIS later learned that when Mrs. WARD, because of the death of Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING, decided not to further vacation in Florida and had flown to Panama City on April 6, 1968, to obtain the remainder of her clothing, that Mr. and Mrs: HASTINGS had expressed some displeasure to Mrs. WARD. about having as guests Mrs. WARD, Mrs. DAVIS and Rev. A.D. WILLIAMS KING. Mrs. DAVIS belleved the HASTINGS originally came fron Birmingham and recalled that Rev. A.D. WILLIAMS KING used to pastor a church there.

Memphis, Tennessee from Panama City, Florida, and registered at the Lorraine Motel at about 1 a:m., April 4, 1968. Rev. KING and Mrs. DAVIS did the registering and Mrs. DAVIS occupied Room 201 and Mrs. WARD Room 207.

Immediately upon their arrival at the Lorraine Motel, Mrs. WARD, Mrs. DAVIS and Rev. A.D. WILLIAMS KING started making inquiry of other guests at the motel as to the whereabouts of Rev. KING's brother, Dr. MARYIN LUTHER KING. He could not be located at the motel and HOSEA NiLLIAMS remarked thai )r. KING was at a strategy meeting at a church, the name o1 which Mrs. DAVIS recalls as the Church of the Miminal Salary (Phonetic). Mrs. WARD, Mrs. DAVIS and Rev. KING then went to the church but Dr. KING was Rev. ANDREW YOUNG and some other people, identities.not known to Mrs. DAVIS but appearing to be possibly local pastors and ministers, were holding a meeting at the church. A man called "CABBAGE" was speak- ing at the meeting when Mrs. DAVIS and her companions arrived,

but Mrs. DAVIS and her companions did not stay at the meeting panions went to a smaller room in the church where they met REV. JESSE JACKSON Iron Chicago, Illinois and conversed with upon learning Dr KING was not there Mrs. DAVIS and her comRev. JACKSON/ for a few minutes.

went to Roon 207.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, Rev. RALPH ABERNATHY, and Rev. BERNARD LEE. Mrs. WARD immediately went out and 1nvited the three individuals into Room 207. Doctor KING and his companions joined Mrs. DAVIS and her companions in Room 207. After approximately five minutes Revs. ABERNATHY and. LEE left the roon, presumably to go to their own rooms. Mrs. DAVIS, MrS. WARD, Dr. KING and Rev. KING remained in Room 207 until about 5 a.w. when Dr. KING left, advising he was going to Room 306.

During the conversation by the above individuals in Room 207 no one made any mention of indication that they were fearful of any attempt being made that day on Dr. KING's life.

After Dr. KING left Room 207, Mrs. DAVIS also left the room and went to Room 201. About one-half hour later, Dr. KING came to Room 201 and visited with Mrs. DAVIS for about to DI. KING that Miss KATHERINE BADIN of Kentucky was running for U.S. Senator from Kentucky, and Dr. KING indicated he had met Miss PEDIN as ghe had interviewed him as a member of the President's Commission on Civil Disorders. Also during this visit Mrs. DAVIS told Dr KING that in view of the. mrch in Memphis, Tennessee having been rescheduled fron April 5 to April 8, 1968, Mrs. DAVIS would probably not remain in Memphis over the weekend, KING asked that before Mrs. DAVIS made a final decision he would like to talk to her further about this but that he had to leave as he had a strategy meeting planned in Room 306 at 8 a.m.; April 4, 1968, and he anticipated he would re-contact,

her about her decision about noon, April 4, 1968.

Short after Dr. KING left Roon 201, Mrs. WARD joined Mrs. DAYIS in Room 201 where they had coffee and conversed until about noon when Mrs. WARD left. About I p.m. or 1:30 p.m. Dr. KING returned to Room 201 and advised Mrs. DAVIS that he needed to relax for a short while and left Room 306 so as not to be bothered unless important matters occurred. From Room 201 Dr. KING phoned Room 306 and spoke with Rev. LEE advising Rev. LEE as to his whereabouts and informed Rev. LEE he did not want to be disturbed unless it was an important matter. While in Room 201 on this occasion Dr. KING made several phone calls using a credit card. Mrs. DAVIS recalls that DI. KING phoned his secretary, DORA MCDONALD, 1n Atlanta, Georgia, and also made a call to New York, identity of person called not specifieally remembered. by Mrs. DAVIS, but possibly being a STAN LEVINSON (phonetic) or a (First Name Unknown) WACKTEL (phonetic) as Mrs. DAVIS had heard Dr. KING speak of these individuals.

Thereafter as Dr. KING Was in Atlanta, Georgia, just dialing his mother Rev. A.D. WILLIAMS KING came into Room 201 and Dr. KING and Rev. A.D. WILLIAMS KING conversed with their mother telephonically for a few minutes. About 45 minutes later Revs. ABERNATHY and KEE came to Room 201 and Mrs. DAVIS then phoned Mrs. WARD and invited her to Room 201. Mrs. WARD did come to Room 201.

Shortly after Mrs. WARD's arrival in Roon 201, Mrs. WARD left to pick up some cleaning for Mrs. DAVIS at a laundry and dry cleaning store, name not recalled, located at Beale and Third Streets. in Memphis. Mrs: WARD had taken the cleanaccompanied on that occasion by Rev. A.D. WILLIAMS KING.

BILLY KALES in Memphis and he invited Mrs. DAVIS to join him for dinner She advised him that she would need

about I5 minutes or so to freshen up and he stated he moula go to his room and freshen up and wait for her. Mrs. DAYIS had just completed her preparation for leaving for dinner be= cause she recalled that she was standing in front of a mirror with her raincoat on taking a last look as to her appearance when she heard a shot. She was stunned for just an instant but then immediately went outside the room and heard someone yell Dr. KING had just been shot. She looked up towards Room 306 and saw what she is convinced were Dr. KING's feet on the balcony protruding slightly over the edge. There was considerable confusion and panic and police arrived almost immediately. Mrs. DAVIS cannot be entirely certain of Immediate events following, but as she recalls Rev.

The above group remained together engaging in just general conversation until approximately 5:40 p.n., April 4, 1968, at which time the group decided that they would go to dinner, and the individuals left to go to their various rooms to freshen up for dinner. Mrs. WARD left Room 201 in the company of Rev, A.D, WILLIAMS KING and the two of them went to Room 207. Rev. A.D.

Approximately 15 - 20 minutes after arriving in Room 207 at which time Rev. to the room and looked out and "heard someone yell that Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING had just been shot. The news stunned Mrs. WARD and while she cannot be exactly certain of her exact movements immediately thereafter, as she recails upon hearing the news she briefly re-entered Room 207 and then immediately went out into the courtyard of the motel. There was much confusion and police were immediately in the area. Mrs. WARI observed nothing which gave her any indication as to the possible identity of the individual responsible for the shooting. Mrs. WARD recalls that she did not advise Rev. A.D. WILLIAMS KING of the shooting of his brother until about 20 minutes after the incident occurred. Rev. KING's reaction was one of extreme grief and he gave no indication that he had any idea as to the identity of the person responsible.

'As Mrs. WARD recalls, soneone, specific identity not now recalled, thought it best that Mrs. WARD, Mrs. DAVIS and Rev. A.D. WILLIAMS KING not remain the remainder of the night of April 4 - 5, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel. Accordingly, at about 10 p.m. They left the motel and went to the home of a Rev. WILLIAM KYLES whom Mrs. WARD believes is &amp; minister in Memphis. Rev. MYLES or someone suggested that Rev. A.D. WILLIAMS KING remain at his home that evening and that Mis. WARD and Mrs DAVIS obtain motel accommodations at a nearby Howard Johnson's Motel. Mrs. DAVIS and Mrs. WARD did go to such a motel and Mrs. WARD registered in the motel, but just as she did so HOSEA WILLIAMS who was present at the time decided that Mrs. WARD, Mrs. /DAVIS and Rev.

She tels that she made this mistake in that she had earlier talked to the HASTINGS who had told her they were originally from Birmingham, Alabana.

advised Mrs. room for Mrs." WARD. Hys. WARD felt this statement to be untrue as there appeared to be room at the motel, and she spoke rather plainly to Mrs. HASTINGS about her feeling that Mrs. HASTINGS did not want her at the motel because she had been in the company of two Negroes, Rev. KING and Mrs. DAVIS. Mrs. HASTINGS made some comment about they, the HASTINGS, run a respectable motel, and Mrs. WARD replied that it was because the motel had that reputation that she and her companions had originally decided to vacation there.

Mrs. WARD stated that it appeared to her that the motel owners, the hastings, did not object to herself and Mrs. DAVIS having occupied the motel, but apparently objected to the presence in the motel of Rev. A.D. WILLIANS KING.

Mixs. WARD stated that at no time did either of-the HASTINGS make any type of specific threat to Mrs. WARD, against Mrs. WARD or her companions, but it was clear to Mrs. WARD

that she was no longer welcome at the HASTINGS' motel.

Mrs. WARD left Panama City by plane about 1:30 p.m. on April 6, 1968 and flew to Atlanta, Georgia, where she was
