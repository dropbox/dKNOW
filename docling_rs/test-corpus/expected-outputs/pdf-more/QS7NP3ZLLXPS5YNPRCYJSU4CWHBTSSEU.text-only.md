In December 2024 the Virginia Department of Emergency Management (VDEM) informed the City of Alexandria Fire Department (AFD), Office of Emergency Management (OEM) that they would be conducting a desk review pertaining to several grants totaling $9,309,214.84 . The grants involved in this review are listed below:

## Discussion

VDEM also gave AFD instructions to complete a monitoring preparation document that requested the following documents prior to the desk review:

- -Ledger reports charged to each grant for the award period, the financial audit for the prior 2 years, and the indirect cost and fringe rate agreements
- -Financial and administrative files for grants under review
- -List of awardees and files for each sub-award related to grant projects
- -Policies and procedures manuals
- -Quarterly progress reports and general ledger reconciliations for each grant
- -Supporting documentation for expenditures and payments charged to grants
- -Evidence that interest accrued is in compliance with grant requirements.
- -Copies of contracts/agreements over $5,000, all position descriptions for personnel whose salaries were charged to grants, and all equipment inventory listings.

During the desk review OEM was able to produce all the documents requested above. There were a few supplemental procurement related documents as well as photo documentation that VDEM requested OEM provide. On February 26 th , 2025, VDEM contacted OEM and informed them that after providing the additional documents they have completed the desk review. They informed AFD that the completed monitoring form would act as the clearing/summarizing document for the review. No findings or recommendations were issued by VDEM.

## OIA Analysis of Fire/OEM Engagements:

No engagements have been reported involving OEM for the past several years and the last engagement we have tracked involving the Fire Department concerned a FEMA monitoring review of the Staffing for Adequate Fire &amp; Emergency Response (SAFER) grant. No findings or recommendations resulted from that engagement either.

## Conclusion:

Based on the department's completion of the measures specified by VDEM we consider this engagement closed. Should you have any questions, please contact me at internalaudit@alexandriava.gov or via phone at 703.746.4742.
