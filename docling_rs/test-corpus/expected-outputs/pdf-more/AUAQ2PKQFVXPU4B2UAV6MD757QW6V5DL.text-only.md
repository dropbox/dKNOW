## A Smart Wearable Air Quality Monitor Using MEMS Ultrasound Technology

As a part of the "Dr. Anwarul Abedin Lecture Series", a regular development initiative of the American International University-Bangladesh (AIUB), the Faculty of Engineering (FE) at AIUB organized  a  webinar  titled "A  Smart  Wearable  Air  Quality  Monitor  Using  MEMS  Ultrasound Technology" on Thursday, August 19, 2021 in Dhaka from 10:30 AM to 12:00 PM.

The webinar was inaugurated with a welcome address by Dr. ABM Siddique Hossain (Professor and Dean, Faculty of Engineering, AIUB). He started by paying gratitude to Dr Anwarul Abedin, AIUB's Founder- Chairman, who contributed significantly to the development of the university. He then presented a quick overview of the need to monitor air quality in human society and highlighted the need of engineering skills development.

The esteemed guest speaker of this webinar was Dr. Chowdhury Fazlur Rahim, President and CEO, Aromatix Inc. During his lecture, Dr. Rahim shared his experience of 35 years at companies such as Intel, Bell Labs, MicroLinear, and 24 years at Maxim integrated. He served as an Executive Director of Design a Maxim integrated products developing and commercializing analog mixedsignal semiconductors and sensor products and has extensive industry contacts for developing gas sensors, among several other positions while at Maxim. He has successfully commercialized 30  innovative  integrated  circuits  relating  to  sensor  and  sensor  interfaces  and  many  more derivative products. He has 15 patents and a dozen papers in internationally recognized journals. Since founding Aromatrix, he has assembled a unique team of engineers who were instrumental in developing a portable ultrasound gas sensor solution. He has also filed three patents to date on a unique innovative technology, viz. a fully solid-state ultrasound gas sensor, uniquely suited for a first-of-its-kind medical device to facilitate COPD and asthma patients monitor their health while at home or on the road. He is now actively involved with raising capital to develop the final product.

One in every six people on the planet suffers from respiratory problems such as COPD, asthma, or hyperventilation. His world-first solid-state portable gas sensor system is the only one that can assist these individuals in determining the quality of the air in their local proximity and decide whether to go out or take  effective treatment. Aromatrix  demonstrated  the  viability of  high selectivity  and  sensitivity  gas  sensors  in  a  variety  of  environmental  circumstances,  including humidity  and  temperature.  For  carbon  dioxide,  this  breakthrough  was  accomplished  by  the combination of machine learning with a high-resolution ultrasonic MEMS sensor. The speaker discussed  the  difficulties  inherent  in  developing  portable  air  quality  sensors.  It  involves integrating four disciplines: MEMS ultrasonic sensor, application-specific integrated circuit, gas sensing functionalization, and finally, machine algorithm to improve gas sensing precision in realworld settings.

Solid Waste Disposal and its Impact on Surrounding Environment of Matuail landfill Site, Dhaka, Bangladesh

Author: Dr. S. Mosaddeq Ahmed et al.

Brief Description:

An investigation was  conducted  to  assess  the  impact  of  solid  waste  disposal  on  surrounding environment  of  Matuail  landfill  site  of  Dhaka  city.  Three  different  locations  such  as  current dumping, abandoned and its surrounded agricultural areas of Matuail landfill were selected for soil and plant samples, leachate from active dumping and fish samples from treated leachate pond. The Cu, Zn and Pb concentrations were high in the dumping (360 µg g-1 Cu, 806 µg g-1 Zn

[DOCUMENT TITLE]

and 382 µg g-1 Pb) and abandoned (199 µg g-1 Cu, 452 µg g-1 Zn and 519 µg g-1 Pb) areas that exceeded the permissible limits. The heavy metal concentrations in plant samples did not show any significant contamination except Cu, Zn and Pb that also exceeded the permissible limits. On the other side, the organic matter and nutrient concentrations such as N, P, K and S of both soil and plant samples are within desirable value in the studied area. The concentrations of DO, BOD, COD and TDS of the untreated leachate were found 1.34 mg L-1, 96 mg L-1, 1343 mg L-1 and 7120 mg  L-1,  respectively  that  exceeded  inland  surface  water  standard  but  after  treatment  the concentrations  of  DO,  BOD  and  TDS  in  the  treated  leachate  pond  were  found  within  the permissible limit. The presence of heavy metal in leachate is not contaminated as it is below the toxic limit. The bioaccumulation of fish from treated pond is extremely high of Fe, Mn, Pb and Ni that exceeded the WHOs permissible limit.

## In Search of an Eco-space in the Age of Anthropocene: Exploring the Horizon of Ecocinema

Author: SHIBAJI MRIDHA et al.

## Brief Description:

Contoured by the spirit of ecocriticism, ecocinema has become a unique platform, especially since the last two  decades,  developing  an  ecocentric  sensibility in the epoch  of  the Anthropocene.  Prominent  ecocinema  critics  such  as  David  Ingram,  Scott  MacDonald,  Paula Willoquet-Maricondi, Adrian Ivakhiv, Pat Brereton, Stephen Rust, and Salma Monani foreground the cognitive and emotive value of cocinema in furthering both environmental imagination and discourse. To contribute to the promising discourse of ecocinema, this essay intends to propose an idea of eco-space that ecocinema can potentially create in the human psyche, allowing us to perceive the non-human world from an ecocentric perspective. Investigating the contemporary ecocinema theory to situate the concept of eco-space in a broader critical context champions the pluralistic and  translational  eco-aesthetics  of  cinema  by  forming  an  alternative  mediaspectatorship.  In  so  doing,  it  seeks  to  draw  secondary  references  on  four  films,  taking  into consideration the usual censure- anthropomorphism, sentimentalism, kitsch- against ecocinema. In the process, this paper espouses the efficacy of ecocinema in creating an evolving eco-space in our collective sub-conscious, transcending the limitations of our customary anthropocentric vision.

Analysis of DDT and its metabolites in soil and water samples obtained in the vicinity of a closed-down factory in Bangladesh using various extraction methods

Author: Dr. Farzana Khalil et al.

## Brief Description:

This study was conducted to monitor the spread of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD))  in  soil  and  water  to  regions  surrounding  a  closed  DDT  factory  in  Bangladesh.  This fulfillment was accomplished using inter-method and inter-laboratory validation studies. DDTs (DDT and its metabolites) from soil samples were extracted using microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), and solvent extraction (SE). Inter-laboratory calibration was assessed by SE, and all methods were validated by intra- and inter-day accuracy (expressed as  recovery  %)  and  precision  (expressed  as  relative  standard  deviation  (RSD))  in  the  same laboratory, at three fortified concentrations (n = 4). DDTs extracted from water samples by liquid -liquid partitioning and all samples were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC)-electron capture detector  (ECD)  and  confirmed  by  GC/mass  spectrometry  (GC/MS).  Linearities  expressed  as determination coefficients (R 2) were ≥0.995 for matrix -matched calibrations. The recovery rate was in the range of 72 -120 and 83 -110 %, with &lt;15 % RSD in soil and water, respectively. The limit  of  quantification  (LOQ)  was  0.0165  m g  kg-1  in  soil  and  0.132  μg  L-1  in  water.  Greater quantities of DDTs were extracted from soil using the MAE and SE techniques than with the SFE method. Higher amounts of DDTs were discovered in the southern (2.2 -936 × 102 mg kg-1) or southwestern (86.3 -206 7 × 102 mg kg-1) direction from the factory than in the eastern direction (1.0 -48.6 × 102  mg  kg-1).  An  exception  was  the  soil  sample  collected  50  ft  (15.24  m)  east (2904 × 102 mg kg-1) of the factory. The spread of DDTs in the water bodies (0.59-3.01 μg L1) was approximately equal in all directions. We concluded that DDTs might have been dumped randomly around the warehouse after the closing of the factory.

## Climate Financing Through the Adaptation Fund: What Determines Fund Allocation?

Author: Dr. Md. Nasir Uddin et al.

## Brief Description:

There  is  an  ongoing  debate  about  criteria  based  on  which  allocation  of  climate  finance, particularly financing adaptation, is made. This article aims at investigating the determinants of fund allocation and the consequences of rearrangement considering the case of the Adaptation Fund (AF). This research conducts a mixed method approach including binary logistic regression and multiple regressions to analyze the factors that influence access to and volume of funding from the AF, respectively, along with a qualitative assessment of the AF's institutional features. The findings suggest that the level of vulnerability of a country is likely to affect accessibility to

[DOCUMENT TITLE]

and the volume of funding from the AF. Besides, low-income countries are more likely while least developed countries are less likely to access the fund. Readiness of country is not significant for accessing the AF; however, it affects the volume of funding. Funding allocation rearrangement may put the AF on pressure for effective use of the readiness program.

## Pyrolysis oil production using different plastic wastes and subsequent usage in power generation

Author: Dr. Nadia Anam et al.

## Brief Description:

It is our intention to design a project that will be capable of generating electricity from different plastic wastes. Waste plastics are currently a global environmental issue and has many associated hazards; additionally, it is not possible to reuse all of the produced plastic through the process of recycling. The generation of electricity through melting of plastic would be very beneficial, but this would require high levels of purity and refinement for commercial use. Following the specific gravity test, we will be able to determine the characteristics of the produced fuels and compare their performance in both diesel and petrol engines. It is hoped that using a generator powered by a diesel or petrol engine, it will be possible to generate electricity from this oil in an innovative manner. At the same time, it might be possible that the gas obtained can be utilized to power a gaseous engine by compression, which is capable of generating electricity as well as creating heat.

## Solar Power Driven Automatic Railway Crossing System with Obstacle Detector to Prevent Accidents in Bangladesh.

Author: Susmita Ghosh et al.

## Brief Description:

In  Bangladesh,  accidents  are  happening  frequently  at  the  railway  crossing  due  to  the  use  of typical manual railway crossing systems/ boom gates. The main reasons are likely having these accidents in the railway crossings due to not possible to stop the train engine mechanism system automatically or instantly such as cars and other vehicles as well as for fewer safety measures in the railway crossing. Currently, there are very few automatic railway crossing systems (without any obstacle detector, just runs with the schedule of the trains crossing) are available, however, all of them are dependent on the national power grid that has no backup plan for any emergency

[DOCUMENT TITLE]

cases. As Bangladesh is running a bit behind in the power generation of its consumption, hence it is not possible to have a continuous power supply at all times. This paper aims to design and develop a railway crossing system with a smart obstacle detector to prevent very common types of accidents in the railway crossing points in Bangladesh. In the railway system, time consumption is the biggest issue that leads to having most of the accidents in the railway crossings. In this research, we design to use two infrared (IR) sensors for opening and closing the railway crossing systems/ gates and the whole system to be controlled by the Arduino. To run the process without having any interruption, we propose to use renewable energy i.e., mainly the solar photovoltaic (PV)  power systems which are economic friendly and apply under the national green energy policy towards achieving the sustainable goal.

## Hybrid Renewable Energy System Based Water Pumping System.

Author: Susmita Ghosh et al.

## Brief Description:

Hybrid energy is a type of energy source where two or more renewable energy system is used to produce energy. The name of the project is Hybrid Renewable System Water Pumping System. In this project both wind turbine and solar panel has been used to generate power. The main purpose of this project is generating power through hybrid renewable system and running water pump using that power. This project is made to reduce the use of power from power grid. It is known that power grid produces huge amount of carbon dioxide. They use fossil fuels which is very dangerous for environment because burning of fuels create huge amount of carbon dioxide. Also generation of power through this process takes less time because both wind turbine and solar  panel  works  together  to  generate  power.  The  goal  of  this  project  was  to  make  it  both environment friendly and money saver at the same time. Rural areas of Bangladesh still don't get enough power supply. So this system can be used in those places so that people in rural areas can get enough water. This project will produce a good amount of electricity which will be stored in a battery. When the water pump will be turned on the pump will take power from the battery. This project will be used in a huge amount in future. This project can be made more useful in future by making the design more simple and implementation of the project easier.

## Inner Relationship among Rapidity, Velocity and Geometric Approach to the Wigner Rotation

Author: Dr. Md. Tarek Hossain et al.

## Brief Description:

Rapidity is a hyperbolic angle that differentiates two frames of reference in relative motion. We demonstrate how this space can be calculated to get various effects resulting from the successive application  of  non-collinear  Lorentz  boosts  and  the  relativistic  addition  of  non-collinear velocities.  We  are  going  to  observe  the  relation  between  rapidity  and  velocity  of  a  moving particle. It has been explained how rapidity space provides a geometric approach to the Wigner rotation  and  the  Thomas  precession.  We  have  also  explained  that  Thomas-  Wigner  rotation occurs due to boost angle θ and velocity.

Author: Dr. Md. Tarek Hossain et al.

## Brief Description:

We have explained the different types of black holes on the basis of their mass, magnetic field and  spin.  We  have  also  derived  the  line  element  of  the  Schwarzschild  black  hole.  We  have clarified the line element of Schwarzschild de- sitter black hole, Schwarzschild Anti-de sitter black hole, Kerr black hole, Kerr de sitter black hole, Kerr Anti-de sitter black hole, Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, Reissner-Nordstrom de- sitter black hole and Reissner-Nordstrom Anti-de sitter black hole. Wigner rotation near the event horizon of black hole has been explained.

## Numerical Calculations of Wigner Rotation in Hyperbolic Space and Schwarchild Black Hole

Author: Dr. Md. Tarek Hossain et al.

## Brief Description:

We have introduced the  Wigner  rotation.  We  represented  special  and  most  general  Lorentz transformations. The velocity addition formula for special and most general Lorentz transformations are clearly explained. We have derived the formula of Wigner rotation in two different ways. We have calculated the numerical values of Wigner rotation for different cases. The graph of the Wigner rotation with respect to different velocities has plotted.

## Dye-sensitized solar cell with plasmonic gold nanoparticles modified photoanode Publication

Author: Dr. Mohammad Mahbub Rabbani et al.

## Brief Description:

The depletion of fossil fuel and environmental anxieties has led to a greater interest in renewable forms of energy. To a large extent, the most prevalent form of renewable energy presently is solar energy. The Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a promising substitute for all too familiar silicon solar cells. DSSC uses dyes as light-harvesting pigments in the conversion of solar energy to electric energy. This study is about the fabrication of DSSC using a photoanode made up of TiO 2 fused with gold nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles enhance the performance of DSSC due to the plasmonic effect. The gold nanoparticles were made by the citrate method and characterized using UV -visible spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering. The performance of the solar cells was accessed via photocurrent and photovoltage measurements. The solar-to-electric power efficiency of the solar cells with gold nanoparticles was found to be about 50% higher than those without gold nanoparticles.
