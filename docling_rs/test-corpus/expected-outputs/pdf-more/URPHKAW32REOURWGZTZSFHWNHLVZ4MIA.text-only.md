## Planning Strategies

Guide to Decision-Making

The Joint Task Force seeks to develop a CIP that:

1. Identifies projects with the highest needs / urgency, are the most ready, and provide the highest value to Alexandria residents.
2. Master Plan 2. Considers the biggest risks to the portfolio if particular projects are delayed, such as critical life safety needs and required or mandated projects.

## Planning Strategies

## Guide to Decision-Making

## The Joint Task Force seeks to develop a CIP that:

3. Provides a strategic city-wide approach that optimizes opportunities and logistical considerations:
- a) for identifying and acquiring new sites for city and school projects, while being opportunistic as situations may arise;
3. Master Plan b) implementing related projects together to ensure economies and synergies are realized;
- c) implementing an optimal 'swing' approach when a City and/or School facility uses need to be displaced during construction;
- d) addresses projected school overcrowding through the implementation of projects that expand student capacity over time;
4. Considers interim measures (mitigation strategies) if urgency timeframes cannot be met.

## Survey

## Key Takeaways

- As of the previous Task Force Meeting, there was a funding gap of more than $120 Million across FY2019 -2027
- To facilitate further development and refinement of the FCIP, B&amp;D developed a survey to assist with balancing the FCIP
- Master Plan · The survey asked Task Force Members to indicate on a scale of 1 to 5 if they supported removing funding for a particular project within this FCIP
- The survey asked Task Force Members to indicate how they would fund the high school capacity project

<!-- image -->

## Survey

## Key Takeaways

- Members agreed that in order to balance this FCIP, funding could be removed for 7 projects: Firing Range, Pre-K Center, Chinquapin Aquatic Center, Fire Station 206, New Elementary School, Gadsby's Tavern, and reduced funding for the Health Department CFMP
- Master Plan · Members indicated that funding for Swing Space should be consolidated with funding for a new school -members desire to see capital funds for a temporary swing space utilized as a future permanent school
- Members indicated that funding for high school construction should occur in FY2021 (or before) in order to provide capacity for the projected peak of 5,000 students in 2023
- Some members indicated Market Square Parking was an opportunity for alternative funding and suggested funding be removed in this FCIP

## Facilities Capital Improvement Plan

## Key Themes

- Initial years have wide swing in funding
- Project readiness key to initial FCIP years -facilities projects in the FCIP have not begun planning or design activities
- Master Plan · FY2018 and 2019 become critical years for planning, feasibility, and project planning
- FY2020 funding is limited in scale, therefore the number of facilities projects that can be funded is limited
- FY2021 High school capacity utilizes majority of funding

## Facilities Capital Improvement Plan

## Discussion

## a) FCIP per Survey

- Represents the prioritized, recommended FCIP based on planning strategies
- Final balancing required: $13.5 Million
- Questions? Comments?

## b) Balanced FCIP
