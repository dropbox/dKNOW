## Hello!

If there's one thing that has become crystal clear to me over the last decade, it's that conventional business wisdom is seriously overrated-especially when it comes to sales and influence.

You know the old saying, like 'always be closing.' Well, here's a different take: Stop selling; start helping. Don't try to convince anyone to buy from you. Focus instead on helping them make the best decision for them right now, even if (gasp!) that doesn't include you. Do this genuinely and you'll win appreciation, loyalty, and (paradoxically) more sales.

At The Get Real Project, we believe that getting unconventional gets results. That's our bottom line. And in the words of Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu, a journey of 1000 miles starts with a single step, which is why we've published this eBook. It includes thirteen thought pieces excerpted from our Weekly Tips series in the critical categories of:

- Mind your mindset;
- Kick conventional wisdom to the curb;
- Play the long game.

Each is accompanied by a 'make it real' challenge for you-a single step towards a different kind of working world.

Imagine what would be possible if salespeople and influencers around the globe demonstrated  the  everyday  behaviors  that  we  believe  in.  Aspirational?  Yes. Challenging? Without a doubt. Worthwhile? We think so.

Especially since there's never been a better time to get real.

## Five best practices to transform your 'sales'

The sales topic is  germane  no  matter what  title  your  business  card  indicates (every  single  one  of  us  is  selling  ideas). Unfortunately,  there's  a  lot  of  really  bad advice out there about how to do it.

Most of us face a conundrum because (1) we hate what we have come to associate with selling and (2) still, we have to do it. I have routinely  proposed  a  ridiculously  simple antidote-so simple that I caution you not to dismiss it: Stop selling; start helping.

Here  are  five  best  practices  for  doing exactly that:

1.  Get  your  mindset  right.  Remember,  the goal of trust-based selling is radically different from the goal of traditional selling: it's  to  help  them do  what's  right  for  them, not to convince them to buy from you. The difference is huge. Helping is other-focused, non-manipulative,  and  trust-building.  Get your  intentions  aligned  and  all  the  right behaviors will naturally follow.

2. Understand their motives. Take the time to listen until you understand where they're coming from. Focus less on the answers, and more on empathy and understanding. When someone is willing to be influenced by you, it's  not because he has been persuaded by your stunning intellect and your perfectlyarticulated  points;  it  is  because  he  feels emotionally comfortable with the decision.

3.  Let  go  of  any  one  particular  sale.  While doing  the  right  thing  for  your  buyer  may cost  you  an  immediate  sale,  it  will  surely gain you at least as many initial sales, more repeat  sales,  and  far  more  referrals  in  the long run.

4. Keep your personal needs out of it. Don't push  for  a  commitment  because  of  your own  incentives,  passions,  frustrations,  or desires for closure. Instead, follow her lead. Work from her timetable.

5.  Stop  thinking/talking/acting  as  though you  need  to  'close'  something.  An  overemphasis on closing usually leads to fewer sales.  Think  about  it:  If  you're  focused  on closing,  you're  focused  on  yourself.  You're not helping them decide. You're not building a relationship.

When  you  sense  it  is  time  for  committed action, simply ask questions like:

'What needs doing next?' 'Where should we go from here?' 'What makes sense now?'

Then  have  a  candid  discussion  about  the answer.  If  five  is  too  many  best  practices to  remember  or  apply,  then  winnow  it down  to  just  one:  get  your  mindset  right. Paradoxically,  you'll  generate  many  more 'sales' when you stop trying to sell. Yes, it really is that simple.

## Three critical insights about your buyers

One thing I find to be universally true with the consulting profession is that efforts to be more effective  with  sales/business  development never  focus  enough  on  the psychology  of buying/selling.  This  article  aims  to  tip  the scales with three important insights.

By psychology I mean 'the scientific study of the human  mind  and  its  functions, especially  those  affecting  behavior  in  a given context' (thank you, Google)-in this case the mind is your buyer's and the context is professional services. That's an important and distinctive context, by the way, because professional services are uniquely complex, intangible,  and  personal.  It's  far  harder  to hear a buyer's lack of unbridled enthusiasm when what they're rejecting isn't a widget, but you.

In  the  past  twelve  years  that  I've  studied the buyer/seller dynamic, here are the most important lessons I've learned so far:

1. Your buyers are naturally skeptical. People universally love to buy yet hate to be sold. That means your buyers are on alert for any interaction, or part thereof, that feels salesy, and they'll instinctively respond with pushback/reservations/doubt/negativity -whether subtly or obviously. Most consultants  aren't  trained  to  hear  this  in the  first  place;  we're  trained  to  lead  with confidence and positivity, and therefore block out other cues. Further, we're most definitely not trained to meet this skepticism with the unconventional approach of leading with our weaknesses, even though social psychology teaches us that's precisely the most effective strategy when skepticism is present.

2.  Your  buyers  are  dealing  with  their  own fears. We sellers aren't the only ones whose ineffective patterns are driven by fear; buyers  are  riddled  with  fear  too,  and  for good reason. Take a  moment  to  think about  just  how  vulnerable  it  is  to  spend thousands/millions on consulting services to fix problems with your organization and your  leadership.  So,  the  onus  is  on  us  to listen carefully for the wide range of signs that fear is present, from slight hesitations to persistently false  bravado.  Genuine empathy is a much-needed tool here, as is a willingness to share our own vulnerabilitythe latter being one way to level a decidedly unlevel playing field, and to connect human to human, rather than seller to buyer.

## Three critical insights about your buyers

3. Your buyers' decision-making process is largely emotional (and by the way, the same is  true  for  you).  We  all  love  to  believe  that buying decisions are made based on logical, rational reasoning. Too bad it doesn't work that way. 'People buy with their hearts and rationalize with their heads' is an age-old sales  adage,  and  findings  in  neuroscience back this up. That means we have to listen masterfully to understand what buyers really want  (security,  recognition,  peace of  mind,  etc.),  not  just  what  they  need (strategies, systems, data, and more), so that we can discover whether or not we can make a  genuine  connection  to  those  wants.  We also have to consistently and courageously sell by doing, rather than by telling, so that our buyers get a real experience of working with us. Test: Are your sales meetings and oral proposals routinely more like working sessions than presentations? Probably not. Certainly not enough.

While you don't have to be a psychologist to be a trustworthy salesperson, you do have to  understand buyer psychology, and then navigate accordingly.

Efforts to be more effective with sales/business development never focus enough on the psychology of buying/selling.

## MIND YOUR MINDSET

## How people *really* buy

I  owe  this  insight  to  my  co-author,  Charlie Green, and the great thinking he's done on how buyers actually buy professional services.

It  sounds  obvious:  almost  all  buying  of services  happens  in  a  two-step  process, screening and selection. Ho hum, two steps, you  already  know  this,  right?  Here's  the catch: most people in professional services make  a  critical  mistake  with  these  two 'simple' steps.

The  screening  step answers  the  question, 'Can they do it?' Answering it is a largely analytical  process  that  requires  research but  very  little  direct  interaction.  Buyers collect data about you and other providers: expertise, scale, geography, and more. They mostly judge your organization by the more rational  and  logical  variables  of  the  trust equation:  credibility  and  reliability.  They create  a  short  list  of  providers  who  move onto the selection step.

The selection step answers a very different question: 'Do we want to work with them?' It's  a  much more emotional question, even though buyers may not realize it (or admit it publicly). Answering it requires personal interactions, where buyers are mostly judging  the people  in  your  organization by  the  more  emotional  and  psychological variables  of  the  trust  equation:  intimacy and self-orientation. You don't emerge from the  selection  process  on  top  because  of competence; you get there because of fit.

When you move from screening to selection, it  gets  personal.  That  big  mistake  most people in professional services make? Treating  the  more  personal  selection  step as  if  you're  still  in  the  more  analytical screening  step.  You  continue  to  market your  organization,  rather  than  selling  the people in it.

Here's a test: Open the PowerPoint deck you used  in  your  last  oral  proposal.  Are  your opening slides all about you: your expertise, scale,  geography,  and  more?  If  so,  you're leading  with  your  qualifications,  despite the  fact  that  you've  already  passed  the screening process. Even if your buyer starts off with, 'So, tell us about your firm' … don't. Turn  the  conversation  to  them.  Be  open, honest,  curious,  passionate.  Give  them  an experience of you, not a recitation of your expertise.  Treat  the  oral  proposal  like  the first meeting after you've won the job.

It's  kind  of  like  dating.  Does  your  dinner companion  want  to  hear  how  great  you were on your last 17 dates? No. And neither does your client.

## What a jockey can teach us about great sales

While I'm not much of a sports fan, I couldn't help  but  get  at  least  a  little  caught  up  in American Pharoah's Triple Crown win in 2015.

I was even more struck by comments Victor Espinoza made after the race. Espinoza is the jockey who rode American Pharoah to victory. Here's what he's quoted as saying:

'I tell you, the first turn, I had the best feeling I ever have. … I didn't even know what pole it is, half a mile, 5/8ths, I was just having fun.'

Maybe those are just the words of a man for whom victory was so close he could taste it (which naturally would be a lot of fun).

Or  maybe  those  are  words  of  a  man  who understands  that  the  best  way  to  ensure victory  is  to  be  in  the  moment. Enjoy  the moment.  Never  mind  the  outcome;  it's  in the future, and it will be what it will be. For now,  immerse  yourself  wholeheartedly  in the race of a lifetime. Above all else, have fun in the process.

## Use this guide to grade your sales stuff

I've always said the best litmus test for the true effectiveness of any sales training-or sales methodology or process or whateveris  to  imagine  your  clients  being  privy  to everything that's communicated.

E-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g.

Try this simple test to see how you fare.

-  Consider  your  sales  training  materials and programs. What if you were sitting in a classroom and you turned around to find five of your best clients listening from the back of the room? Would this be a banner day  or  a  bad  day?  So  much  of  what's taught  in  conventional  sales  training  is trust-neutralizing, if not downright trustdegrading.  You  may  not  realize  to  what extent your curriculum objectifies clients, and/or  teaches  you  how  to  manipulate them  (even  if  it's  'benevolently'),  until you examine the content from their point of view.
-  Consider  the  decks  you  use  at  internal meetings. Specifically, take a peek at  what  you  document  in  terms  of accomplishments and goals. How would it feel for you if some or all of the slides landed  in  a  client's  inbox?  How  would it  feel  for them?  I  still  recall  a  slide belonging to one global client that defined

their primary annual goal as dominating the  market,  with  a  secondary  goal  of providing exemplary client service. I suggested  they  switch  the  order  to  pass the trust-building test.

-  Consider the everyday language you use internally.  Do  you  routinely  talk  about 'suspects'  and  'targets'  (as  in,  'She's  a target')? Do you coach each other on how to  'get  so-and-so  to  sign  on  the  dotted line?'  Ask  yourself  whether  you  would like to be spoken about in these ways. So many well-intended sales professionals (along  with  professionals  who  simply think they should be more sales savvy) use  language  every  day  that  hurts  the very  relationships  they  are  trying to build. Language matters-even if we only use it internally-because the words we choose  both  reflect  and  shape  the  way we think about things, including how we think about the very people we're trying so mightily to serve.

Be  a  hard  grader  on  your  team  and  your organization.  How  much  of  what  you  find is cringe-worthy, a source of pride, or somewhere in between? If trust-building is your aim, then do what needs to be done to pass the litmus test.

## KICK CONVENTIONAL WISDOM TO THE CURB

## How (NOT) to turn 'suspects' into 'prospects'

I've borrowed the title of this article ('How (NOT)  to  turn  'suspects'  into  'prospects'') from the title of a recent article shared by a well-respected sales training organization. I  added  the  'NOT'  and  some  choicelyplaced quotation marks as an act of rebellion  against  the  words  they  chose. Why  the  fervor?  Because  so  many  wellintended  sales  professionals  (along  with professionals who simply think they should be  more  sales  savvy)  use  language  every day that kills off the very relationships they are trying to build.

OK,  'kills  off'  might  be  the  most  extreme, although it happens. For sure it's language the draws down on trust. Language matters because the words we choose both reflect and  shape  the  way  we  and  others  think about  things,  as  well  as  people-including the people we're trying so mightily to serve.

I learned long ago from Charlie Green to not only stop using the word 'objections,' but to stop even thinking  in terms of objections. Same goes for 'closing.' I'm officially adding 'suspects' and 'prospects' to the list. Let's get  'target'  on  there  too,  which  is  all-toooften used by partners in one of the biggest global  consulting firms in the world (until they've been  to one  of our  trust-based selling workshops).

Here  are  three  general  guidelines  for  the words you choose, in a sales context or any context for that matter. Don't use language that:

1. Refers to others in ways you wouldn't want to be referred to
2.  You might be embarrassed or uncomfortable if they knew you were using
3.  Objectifies them in any way.

I realize that annihilating 'suspect'/'prospect' poses a challenge if you're trying to communicate your relationship stage. Fine, then how about simply using 'desired client'? Personally, I'd feel good if I knew I was being referred to as a 'desired client,' even if you weren't a desired provider. Who doesn't  want  to  be  desired?  If  that's  too creepy,  then  how  about  'future  client'?  I might appreciate the confidence conveyed in that. If that's too presumptuous, then how about 'possible client'? I don't mind being part of your possibility.

Just please don't make me a 'suspect,' and I definitely don't want to be your 'target.'

## KICK CONVENTIONAL WISDOM TO THE CURB

## Is this slide lurking in your decks, too?

I  made  my  way  back  up  the  aisle  of  an airplane not long ago, and caught a glance of  a  laptop  screen  with  an  all-too-familiar display: a presentation slide with about 20 logos on it. Ah yes, the picture that's worth 1000 words, meant to convey, 'We work with organizations  like  yours,  or  organizations that should impress you, or both.' I assumed it was part of a pitch deck and immediately wondered how far into the deck this slide found itself.

Do you know where your variation of this slide appears in your decks? Do you know where it should appear? Hint: The answer is not, 'Early on.'

'But  wait!'  you  say,  'We  have  to  create context. We have to build our credibility. We have to be responsive to their request to tell them about us!'

All true. Only not up front. And not nearly in as many slides as you usually dedicate. Early  on  should  be  all  about  them,  not all  about  you.  That's  because  everyone's favorite  subject  is  …  not  you.  Besides,  if you're pitching, you've presumably passed the screening process and moved into the selection  stage,  so  stop  leading  with  your qualifications. Turn  the conversation  to them. Be open, honest, curious, passionate. Give  them  an experience  of  you,  not  a regurgitation of your expertise.

'But  wait!'  you  say,  'What  if  this  isn't  a pitch, but one of our first interactions? They need some background. They need to know who we are. We need to tell them why we're worth they're time!' To which I say all true. Only not up front. And almost certainly not with a deck, unless you treat it as a leavebehind.

I believe my exact words in my passionate plea during a workshop a few weeks ago were,

## 'Scrap the freakin' deck.'

If  that  seems  too  extreme,  then  at  least make  some  serious  modifications  to  get your focus where it should be.

## KICK CONVENTIONAL WISDOM TO THE CURB

## Why you should stop 'overcoming objections' (and how to do it)

There's yet another problem with conventional sales/influence training: a  plethora  of  bad  advice  about  how  to 'overcome objections.'

Many  years ago, Charlie Green taught me  to  beware  that  the  word  'objection' is adversarial, at root. The Microsoft Word  dictionary  I'm  using  right  now  lists the following synonyms: 'opposition,' 'protestation,' 'hostility.' Not the best mindset to adopt when your aim is to work from trust.

The  implication  of  the  phrase  'overcome objections' just makes it worse. The phrase suggests that whatever resistance you get from  the  other  party  should  be  handled/ managed/tackled. Who wants to be handled/ managed/tackled?  Not  I,  not  you,  and  not your  clients.  Personally,  I'd  rather  you  try to understand  me,  all-the-while  making  it clear  that  you're  the  kind  of  person  with whom I can freely share all of my concerns because you've made it clear you have my best interests at heart.

If you want to transform how you 'overcome objections,' do three things:

1.  Think  about  'objections'  the  right  way. An objection is simply the client giving you information.  It's  a  hint-or  maybe  even  a crystal clear communication-about concern, hesitancy,  curiosity.  It  also  sometimes  a way of saying, 'I like what you have to say,

I just have to find a way to justify it.' Either way, it's an invitation to engage. Once you change  your  thinking  from  'objection'  to 'invitation,'  you're  free  to  get  down  to  the business of helping your client.

## 2.  Pursue  their  concerns  wholeheartedly.

List  them.  Say  things  like,  'Ah,  I  see,  so you have a concern about …' Shine a light on them. Explore them. Ask to hear more of them. Lean into them. Suggest them.

3. Meet emotion with emotion. Say (genuine) things like, 'I can see why that's troubling. You're  hesitating  because  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  And that  makes  sense,  since  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.'  Not only are you likely to learn more (and can therefore do a better job of helping), you also prove  you're  really  listening  and  that  you actually … drumroll … care.

In the end, if you can successfully address all of your client's concerns, great; you'll get a sale. If  you can't, it probably means that what's on the table is just not the right thing right  now-in which case there's only one thing to do: back out gracefully. Then you'll not  only  build  trust,  you'll  dramatically increase  your  chances  of  making  the  sale when your offer is the right thing. You can see  it's  a  world  apart  from  the  usual,  'If  I could X, would you Y?'

Here's  the  two-line  version  of  this  entire missive:  Stop  handling  objections.  Have conversations that help your clients instead.

## KICK CONVENTIONAL WISDOM TO THE CURB

## 'Learn TIPS and TRICKS to CLOSING MORE DEALS' (or not)

I've  once  again  borrowed  the  title  of  this article ('Learn TIPS and TRICKS to CLOSING MORE DEALS') from the subject line of an email I once received. When I read it, I let out a very loud groan.

On the one hand, I get it. I get the very real desire to figure out how to be more successful as a business developer or salesperson by learning  practical  actions  you  can  take  to cross  the  proverbial  finish  line.  And  I  get that  someone  who's  selling  sales  training wants  to  connect  with  their  audience  by promising just that.

On the other hand, the subject line in-andof-itself is a brilliant illustration of exactly what's  so  wrong  with  sales  training  and sales approaches today.

Your clients love to buy. They don't like to be sold. And they almost universally hate to be 'closed.'

The same is true for you. Think about the last  time  someone  tried  to  'close'  you.  It probably left a bad taste in your mouth. And for good reason.

Yet  sales  lingo  continues  to  focus  on  closingthat  dramatic  end  point  to  a  transaction, when, in theory, the salesperson overcomes any lingering objections and convinces the client to finally 'sign on the dotted line.'

With  trust-based  relationships,  the  close isn't  the  end  or  the  goal;  it's  just  another point in an ongoing relationship. Attempts to close actually close down the conversation. They're seller-centric, not client-centric. They make for really big trust problems.

If you're reading this, the chances are  better  than  good  that  you're  not  a smarmy  salesperson.  You're very likely a  professional  with  good  intentions  and something valuable to offer. The problem is, if your mindset is off, your buyer is going to sense it-subtly or overtly. If you do or say or think anything that smacks of, 'I want to get them to \_\_\_\_,' where the fill-in is about you, you're screwed.

What's the antidote? Wrap your head around one simple goal, which is to help your client make a good decision-one that may or may not  involve  you.  That's  it.  It  really  is  that simple.  Change  your  intention  and  all  the right behaviors will naturally follow.

Here's  my  simple  plea:  Stop  closing.  Stop using any variation of the word. Stop looking for 'tips and tricks' for how to do it. Instead, make things better for your client, whatever that looks like.

## KICK CONVENTIONAL WISDOM TO THE CURB

## Why 'one of the most common closes used' is also one of the worst

I  was  shopping  for  a  Halloween  costume one year and I was reminded of a big sales no-no  in  the  process-that  is,  if  you  want to  sell  the  trust-based  way.  And  while  my experience was in the realm of retail, it's also a cautionary tale for anyone in professional services.

The  store  was  collecting  donations  for  a charity  benefitting  kids,  or  so  I  learned when I presented my credit card to pay and was  asked,  'How  much  would  you  like  to donate to XYZ today?'

My  immediate  and  unfaltering  response: 'None.'

Funny  thing,  though,  because  I  just  about always  make  at  least  a  small  donation when I'm asked at checkout, as is often the case  these  days  at  the  grocery  store  and the pet store. How I'm asked makes all the difference:

- Q: '  Would you like to donate to the ABC fund to help with DEF?'
- A: '  Sure.'
- Q: '  How much would you like to donate to XYZ today?'
- A: '  None.'

Those  two  little  assumptive  words  at  the beginning  of  the  second  example  ('how much') are anathema to trust.

I Googled 'assumptive close,'  assuming (hoping)  I  would  find  long  outdated  sales wisdom. No such luck. Web pages authored this year  still extoll the  virtues  of  the technique-the same web pages, apparently, that the Halloween retail store I patronized has been using to train its cashiers.

One site, dated February 2017, asserts that, 'while your assumptions may  be completely wrong, your confidence can be contagious.' Another, dated May 2017, refers to  the  assumptive  close  as  a  technique that 'makes you come across as pushy and self-serving'  (thank  you!),  then  goes  on  to suggest  18  alternative  closing  lines,  all  of which make my skin crawl. No wonder, as they're  all  positioned  as  'non-aggressive closing  questions  to  make  the  buyer  feel comfortable-without completely taking off the pressure.'

Let's be clear: pressure plays no role whatsoever in any trust-based conversation.

Here's  the  point  as  it  relates  to  anyone  in professional  services:  You  probably  know better  than  to  apply  an  assumptive  close with your clients.  Beware,  though.  You might be over-eager at times, thinking your confidence will be contagious. Or you might not  realize  that  asserting  a  point  of  view prematurely  can  trigger  the  same  kind  of knee-jerk  reaction  I  had  at  the  Halloween costume store ('Heck no!') simply because people don't like to feel pushed in any way.

Pushy:  bad.  Positive:  good.  Trustworthy: best of all.

## KICK CONVENTIONAL WISDOM TO THE CURB

## Pretty please: Separate the ask from the acknowledgment

I once got a call from a volunteer at one of the charitable organizations to which I regularly donate. It was decidedly different than the usual solicitation call. It started off so much better. And then it got so much worse.

To the volunteer's credit, it was clear from the get-go that he wasn't reading a script. Or if he was, he did a great job of making it sound like he wasn't, unlike so many.

Also to his credit, he spent a good several minutes  acknowledging  me  for  being  a regular contributor, and telling me in detailed, concrete terms-and with what seemed like genuine excitement-the  difference that my contributions make. It was much more than the typical and gratuitous, 'Thanks for your past support.'

Oh how I wished he had stopped there and simply  said  thanks  again  and  goodbye. Imagine how great I would have felt-about myself, about him, about his organization. And how impressed I would have been by the  call  with  no  agenda  other  than  to  say 'thank you.'

Alas, he didn't stop there.

He  continued  and  said  what  I  feared  he was  going  to  all  along  (and  what  had  me distracted with anticipation during all the great  things  he  was  saying):  'Would  you increase your donation amount?'

It was a fair question to ask.

The problem with his request was it left me feeling  like  all  the  nice  stuff  he  had  said prior was a load of crap-a flowery lead-in to the real reason for his call. This created a disconnect for me because he had seemed so genuine when he was speaking.

Here's the problem, as I see it: He collapsed the two conversations: the acknowledgment and the ask. As a result, the ask essentially erased  the  acknowledgment  and  left  me feeling …  blech. (For the  record, I also promptly said 'no.' I might very well have said yes had the ask just been an ask.)

I  think  getting  real  means  being  willing to  offer  real  acknowledgments  that  are unencumbered and left to stand on their own.

## What baked goods can teach us about lasting client relationships

Some years ago I was surprised by a knock at the  door-an  unexpected  delivery  of baked goods from a local sweet shop. The package included a hand-written note from Kacy, the office organizer I had hired exactly one year before. The sweets were to commemorate my first  anniversary  in  my new home office, with a reminder that she was available should any lingering piles be in my way, and a no-obligation request to tell others about her services if I was so inclined.

I  immediately logged onto Facebook (well, by 'immediately' I mean right after I ate a cookie)  and  posted  kudos  for  Kacy,  along with a link to her web site. (And I've referred her many times since. For years.)

While this might seem like a great marketing story, don't be fooled; Kacy's actions are as much about deepening client relationships as they are about marketing. And anyone in any role can learn and benefit from her best practices.

In the parlance of the trust equation, Kacy's gesture was a clear demonstration of high intimacy and low self-orientation, with a little dash of credibility in the mix as well:

-  Kacy acknowledged me, in a very personal way;
-  She let me know she cared about me-enough to keep track of, and commemorate, the anniversary of our work together;
-  Kacy was generous, without expectation of return (which, by the way, is why I felt inspired, not obligated, to refer her);
-  She had the confidence to ask for more work.

Plus  there's  one  other  great  lesson  here: Being in touch with clients takes focus and effort, not time. One touch-point in a twelve month  period  might  be  plenty,  if  it's  the right touch point.

## Are you willing to go this far for your clients?

I'm  a  big  fan  of  stories  as  vivid  illustrations of things that matter and make a difference when it comes to trust-building. Consider this short and compelling one from The Trusted Advisor Fieldbook. It's told by a savvy private wealth manager in Canada and it reveals the extent of the long-term view he takes with his clients:

- '  I once offered to do some free investment planning for a client's 12- and 14-year-old children. My co-worker was confused why I was wasting my time with children.
- '  That's easy! I regularly meet with clients' children and explain the concept of saving, investing and risk.  Even at the ages mentioned I have had success in making the experience relevant for the children and ultimately appreciated by the parents.
- '  I believe in long-term focus and relationships. While working with clients' children has resulted in referrals (which is a happy outcome) that is never our primary intent. Our purpose is to build long-term relationships by continuously delivering a 'remarkable experience' for our clients and their families.'

Kinda makes you think, doesn't it? Just how committed are you to delivering a 'remarkable experience' to the people you serve?

We're  a  big  fan  of  running  experiments here  at  The  Get  Real  Project:  a  defined  set of  time  when  you  try  out  a  new  behavior or  practice.  An  experiment  can  last  a  day, a  week,  or  a  month.  The  key  is  it's  finite, which  means  you  don't  have  to  commit  to a  lifelong  change.  Somehow,  this  makes  it more  palatable  to  just  try  it  out  for  a  bit, and  ironically  makes  it  more  likely  you'll actually  make  a  lifelong  change.

Here  are  13  'make  it  real'  challenges  for you,  one  for  each  article in this collection. Choose  the  ones  that  grab  your  attention and  interest,  and  then  make  an  experiment for  yourself  or  your  team  (or  both).

## Five best practices to transform your 'sales'.

Bring  to  mind  a  time  when  you  did  not successfully 'close a sale.' To what extent did  you  apply  the  five  best  practices  to transform your sales (get your mindset right, understand their motives, let go of any one particular  sale,  keep  your  personal  needs out  of  it,  and  stop  thinking/talking/acting as though you need to 'close' something)? What will you do differently next time?

## Three  critical  insights  about  your  buyers.

Sit  down  with  your  team  and  examine  a past  sale/proposal  gone  wrong.  In  what ways did you fail to recognize one of these three  insights:  your  buyers  are  naturally skeptical,  your  buyers  are  dealing  with their own fears, and your buyers' decisionmaking process is largely emotional? What could you do differently next time?

How people really buy. Practice a 20-second response when people ask you to tell them more  about  you.  Or  better  yet,  start  with, 'What  would  you  like  to  know?'  and  then keep it brief and other-focused. What happens when they're a more active part of the conversation?

## What a jockey can teach us about great sales.

Make it a goal to have fun during your client interactions-especially when the possibility of new business is on the table. What's fun about what you do? What's fun about what you sell? What's fun about your clients? Put your attention there and see what happens as a happy byproduct.

## Use  this  guide  to  grade  your  sales  stuff.

Gather some samples of your sales training materials and programs, the decks you use at internal meetings, the everyday language you  use  internally,  and  do  a  little  hardgrading. What do you discover?

## How (NOT) to turn 'suspects' into 'prospects'

Watch  your  words.  Notice  the  terms  you habitually use,  even  with  the  best  of  intentions, that  could  be  negatively  impacting  either your mindset about relationship-building, your actual relationships, or both.

Is this slide lurking in your deck, too? Open the PowerPoint deck you used in your last oral  proposal,  put  yourself  in  your  clients' shoes, and be a hard grader on your first five slides. What edits do you see to make? By when will you make them?

Why you should stop overcoming 'objections' (and how to do it). Notice any tendencies you have  to  overcome/handle/manage  when someone expresses something that sounds like an 'objection'-in any context, not just a 'sales' situation. Catch yourself in the act. Bonus: Try a different kind of response and see what happens.

'Learn TIPS and TRICKS to CLOSING MORE DEALS' (or not). Replace closing language with action language-in any conversation, not just a sales conversation. When it's time to focus on next steps, ask questions like:

'Where should we go from here?'

'What makes sense now?'

'What needs doing next?'

Then have a candid discussion about the answer.

Why 'one of the most common closes used' is  also  one  of  the  worst. Be  an  observer: notice when you or others around you try to push people in a particular direction. What happens as a result?

Pretty  please:  Separate  the  ask  from  the acknowledgment. Practice  acknowledging people  for  the  sole  and  simple  purpose of  acknowledging  them.  Be  genuine  and agenda-free.  (And  if  you  can't  be  agendafree, at least be honest about it.)

What baked goods can teach us about lasting client  relationships. Think  about  clients with whom you'd like to stay in touch. Make a  list.  What  meaningful  milestones  might you track and acknowledge? What gesture might you make that's distinctive, genuine, and simple?

## Are you willing to go this far for your clients?

Consider what your equivalent of financial discussions with children would be. Stretch your  thinking.  How  might  you  make  a difference for your clients' families or others in their lives who matter to them? Then, if you're  inspired,  take  a  small  step  towards whatever you discover.
