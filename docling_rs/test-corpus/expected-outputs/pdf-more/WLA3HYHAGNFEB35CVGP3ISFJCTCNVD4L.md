Preparation of Activated Carbon/TiO2 Nanohybrids for Photodegradation of Reactive Red-35 Dye Using Sunlight

Author: Dr. Mohammad Tariqul Islam et al.

Brief Description:

Activated carbon/titanium dioxide (AC/TiO2) nanohybrids were synthesized by a hydrothermal technique  using  various  weight  percent  of  commercial  AC  and  were  characterized  by  X-ray diffraction  (XRD),  field  emission  scanning  electron  microscopy  (FESEM),  Fourier  transform infrared (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The synthesized nanohybrids were applied to photodegradation of Reactive Red-35 (RR-35) dye in aqueous solution using sunlight. Due to the synergistic effect of adsorption and photodegradation activity, AC/TiO2 nanohybrids were more efficient in treating the aqueous dye solution than that of AC and TiO2 The maximum (95%) RR-35 dye removal from the water was obtained with 20 wt% AC/TiO2 within 30 min at natural pH of 5.6. The possible photodegradation mechanism of RR-35 dye with AC/TiO2 was discussed from the scavenger test. Moreover, AC/TiO2 was found to be suitable for long-term repeated applications  through  recyclability  experiments.  Therefore,  AC/TiO2 nanohybrid  is  a promising photocatalyst for treating azo dyes especially RR-35 from water.

Sea Water Desalination for Coastal Area Using Concentrated Sunlight and Solar Panel Author: Nadia Nowshin et al.

## Brief Description:

All over the world, it is quite difficult to do the desalination of sea water. Alongside it is very tough to do cultivation and manage daily needs in a coastal area due to lack of distilled water. And the traditional desalination processes are very costly and time consuming at the same time. So, in this project a solar-desalination process is proposed that desalinate sea water with a very low cost and effort. Besides that human civilization is now pushed forward to a new era where every bulk automated structure is getting compact through the use of microcontroller. This incited us to design a microcontroller based solar-desalination system, which is powered by solar energy. The  proposed  model  of  sea  water  desalination  for  coastal  area  uses  concentrated  sunlight through Fresnel Lens as the main factor together with a solar panel. And the whole process of sea water collection to desalination of the water is controlled via an Arduino Uno.

## Transboundary Water Agreements of South Asia: Does the Principle of Equitable and Reasonable Utilization of Water Exist?

Author: Ferdousi Begum et al.

Brief Description:

There are different theories and principles of international water law related to transboundary water resources management. One of the most fundamental principles of transboundary water resources management is the idea of equitable and reasonable utilization of water. This principle reflects the view of regulating the use of international shared water resources. It is introduced by the Helsinki Rules, reinvented by the Draft Articles and finally it recognized as a treaty law when the Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses, 1997 had incorporated this principle in Article 5. In applying this principle the standard is not what is an equitable use for the activities of a State from a shared watercourse rather what is equitable in relation to other States using the same. The scope of using the principle of equitable and reasonable utilization of water depends upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case  and  also  upon  other  surrounding  factors.  There  are  so  many  transboundary  water agreements in South Asian region. This article will examine whether the transboundary water agreements of South Asian region take into account the principle of equitable and reasonable utilization of water while using water from shared water resources. It will also examine how this principle is evolving in international law and so far how it is working in this region.

IoT (Internet of Things) - Based Smart Garbage Management System: A Proposal for major Cities of Bangladesh

Author: MOHAIMEN-BIN-NOOR et al.

Brief Description:

IoT -internet of things has become a buzzword nowadays. There are many IoT based researches but researches on garbage management system based on IoT are not sufficient. Insufficient and inefficient garbage management system causes severe environmental problem. It also makes the air toxic. This problem has become a common problem in the world especially in Bangladesh. Dhaka city, the capital of Bangladesh lacks well organized and efficient garbage management system. Maximum roads of Dhaka city are surrounded by garbage. The bad smell of garbage affects people's mental health, inhaling toxic causes many diseases. Lack of dustbins, throwing of garbage here and there, misuse of dustbins are making city life very unhealthy and also causes a threat to environment. The dustbins are being stolen or damaged which is also a great problem. In this paper, we proposed about an efficient garbage management system based on IoT. This research works aims to provide a minimal solution to this problem using the IoT technology. We propose for a smart garbage system, which consists of sensors, RFID, IR sensors, admin and user website, Wi-Fi module etc. These smart bins will monitor the level of garbage when it will reach 75% of its capacity, it will give notification to the admin website, so the authority concerned can collect the garbage from the bins timely and there will be no overflow of garbage as the authority will get notified earlier. There will be a feature in user website that will let the user know about the nearest smart garbage bins current condition, so if there is any condition that the garbage bin of their place is full they can use the nearest bin. This research work also aims to have secured smart garbage bins, as there is chance the bins to be stolen and damaged so in this research we talk about security of the sensors and the bins will have cement body. So this research is for implementing an efficient garbage management system which will reduce expense on this sector, misuse of bins. Making a clean country, pollution free environment with an efficient and well organized garbage management system can bring a new era. It is expected that the proposed garbage management system will reduce financial cost in this sector as well as reduce problems related to waste management.

Micro-fabricated thermal flow-rate sensors: the substrate material impact on the device performance and power consumption

Author: Dr. Ferdous Jahan Shaun et al.

Brief Description:

Abstract-  We  report  on  micro-machined  flow-rate  sensors  as  part  of  autonomous  multiparameter sensing devices for water network monitoring. Three different prototypes of the flowrate sensors have been designed, fabricated and experimentally characterized. Those sensors are made of identical  micrometric  platinum  resistors  deposited  on  different  substrates,  made  of glass, silicon and micro-structured silicon, with and without insulation layers. The sensors are tested under the anemometric operating scheme. They are experimentally characterized under a  water velocity range from 0 to 0.91 m/s. We show that the glass substrate device is more sensitive  and  less  power-consuming under  identical  operating  condition.  We  also  show  that, when silicon is needed as the substrate material, further optimization and design strategies are required.  Experimental  results  are  analyzed  with  respect  to  computational  fluid  dynamics simulations with the finite element method.

## Sensitivity optimization of micro-machined thermo-resistive flow-rate sensors on silicon

substrates Author: Dr. Ferdous Jahan Shaun et al. Brief Description: We report on an optimized micro-machined thermal flow-rate sensor as part of an autonomous multi-parameter sensing device for water network monitoring. The sensor has been optimized under the following constraints: low power consumption and high sensitivity, while employing a large thermal conductivity substrate, namely silicon. The resulting device consists of a platinum resistive heater deposited on a thin silicon pillar ~100 µm high and 5 µm wide in the middle of a nearly 100 µm wide cavity. Operated under the anemometric scheme, the reported sensor shows a larger sensitivity in the velocity range up to 1 m s-1 compared to different sensors based on similar  high  conductivity  substrates  such  as  bulk  silicon  or  silicon  membrane  with  a  power consumption of 44 mW. Obtained performances are assessed with both CFD simulation and experimental characterization.

## Energy efficient micro-machined thermal flow-rate sensor based on transient operation mode

Author: Dr. Ferdous Jahan Shaun et al.

Brief Description:

We report on a micro-machined thermos-resistive flowrate sensor optimization with respect to energy consumption while using a large thermal conductivity substrate, silicon for instance. Two aspects of the device are optimized for this purpose: its geometry and its operating scheme. Large thermal conductivity materials are not recommended for thermal flowrate sensors since they induce large thermal leakage. However, they can be needed for some lab-on-chip devices where the  co-integration  of  several  sensors  and  components  is  the  main  constraint.  Under  these conditions, we show that the flow-rate sensor thermal efficiency can be increased by geometric optimization  and  its  energy  consumption  significantly  reduced  by  operating  the  device  in transient mode. The original reference device is fabricated on bulk silicon where the heating element is made of platinum (Pt). Then, a geometric optimization is performed to increase the heating resistor thermal insulation by creating a micro-pillar in the middle of a cavity to support the heater. The pillar structure flow-rate sensor exhibits 2.5 °C temperature under no-flow while the  bulk  silicon-based  sensor  shows  0.8  °C  only  under  30  mA  current  supply.  This  larger temperature  increase  under  no  flow  leads  to  a  larger  sensitivity  of  the  former.  In  addition, transient operating mode enables the minimization of the pre-measurement waiting time, hence a reduction of the device energy consumption. While a steady-state measurement requires a heating time of the order of 20 minutes, a transient mode measurement can be performed after a heating time lower than 3 minutes.

## Thin-Film Thermoresistive Platinum Sensor for Water Temperature Measurement

Author: Dr. Ferdous Jahan Shaun et al.

Brief Description:

We report on a micro-machined thin-film temperature sensor for measuring water temperature mainly in the water distribution network. The sensor is made of platinum (Pt) thin-film; which dimensions are 12255 × 11 × 0.34 micrometer. The investigation is performed for two versions of  the  considered  sensor,  where  the  substrate material  is  changed  from  glass  to  silicon.  The sensors  are  tested  at  a  constant  0.5  mA  current  supply.  The  supply  current  intensity  is intentionally  kept  low,  in  order  to  avoid  Joule  Self-heating;  which  is  mandatory  for  ambient temperature measurement. Both sensors show similar Joule self-heating at low current supply. The target is to co-integrate this temperature sensor along with some other sensors on the same chip, in order to deliver a monolithic multi-parametric sensing module. Hence, silicon substratebased temperature sensor is finalized; as this material facilitate the fabrication and cointegration step among multiple sensors. The ascertained sensor shows excellent linearity in the first phase characterization in a laboratory environment within the temperature range from 25 °C to 90 °C. The confidence interval (95%) of the measured data is better than 0.2 °C.

## Understanding the Impact of Social Determinants of Health in Street Food Safety: A Qualitative Study in Bangladesh

Author: Dr. Iffat Tasnim Haque et al.

Brief Description:

Street food is one of the informal sectors, especially in developing countries where it fulfils the daily  food  requirements  for  many  low-  and  middle-income  people.  However,  the  lack  of awareness  about  food  safety  and  unsafe  food  consumption  increase  the  burden  of  diseases which impacts on the health and economic condition of both vendors and customers. The ad hocbased intervention programmes on some particular groups or area cannot be able to promote the knowledge in mass level. Moreover, we need to focus on understanding the other social determinants of health impacting on the behaviour of unsafe street food practices. A qualitative study on understanding the social determinants of health-related with street food safety and health promotion activities was conducted in Khulna city, a third major city in Bangladesh. Both vendors  and  customers  were  participated  in  the  study  through  interviews  and  focus  group discussions. Based on the qualitative thematic analysis of data, four wider social determinants of health  were  found  in  major  which  have  a  strong  impact  on  street  food  safety  behavioural practices among vendors and consumers. Moreover, these determinants also play as barriers to achieve food safety knowledge and practice. Lack of focus on these determinants by macro-level stakeholders,  lack  of  convenient  educational  materials  or  promotional  activities  increase  the severity of the situation. Based on the outcome and participant recommendation, a model has been  developed  to  tackle  the  situation  where  collaborative  approach  is  required  among  all related stakeholders.
