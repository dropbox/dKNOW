SUBJECT: Final Results of Sanctionable Pended Encounters September 2018

Dear Ms. Oestreich:

This attached information will provide the final aged pended encounter sanctions for the quarter ending September 2018. According to the Contract (YHI4-0001-02), Banner University Family Care (UFC) is required to resolve all pended encounters within 120 calendar days of the processing date. If this requirement is not met, the Contractor is subject to sanctions.

The exception to the above is when the pended encounter is due to an Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS) error. AHCCCS error is defined as a pended encounter, which AHCCCS acknowledges to be the result of its own error, and requires a change to the system programming, an update to the database reference table, or further research by AHCCCS. Contractors must notify AHCCCS, in writing that the resolution of a pended encounter depends on AHCCCS instead of the Contractor. Pended encounters do not qualify as AHCCCS error if AHCCCS reviews the Contractor's notification and asks the Contractor to research the issue and provide additional substantiating documentation, or if AHCCCS disagrees with the Contractor's claims of AHCCCS error.

AHCCCS distributed the preliminary sanction results, including a summary of encounters excluded from sanctions as AHCCCS error, on January 24, 2019. The Contractor was provided an opportunity to review the preliminary results, and challenge those encounters believed to be sanctioned in error. The Contractor's submitted mitigation was considered, and when appropriate, the mitigated encounters were removed from the final sanctionable encounters. The preliminary sanctionable number of pendec encounters for UFC was 27,149 and the final sanction number pended encounters for this quarter is

Even if sanctions are waived, the Contractor is liable for addressing all pended encounters (except those rrors which have been identified as due to AHCCCS error or as being under review by AHCCCS Then error codes are identified as an AHCCCS error and are corrected, or are identified as being und AHCCCS review and then released, the Contractor is responsible for addressing any remaining error

codes and will be afforded a new 120 day clock for resolution. However, the true age for these pended encounters will continue to appear on the Aging Reports.

Enclosed is a summary of the final sanction results. Please retrieve your waived encounter sanction information from AHCCCS' FTP server. The path is sftp.state.medicaid.us\UFC\OTHER\ and the file
