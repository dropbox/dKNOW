**Gaspar Olafsen, farmer**

When I started farming there were 40,000 dairy farmer in Denmark. Now there are 3000

400,000 kilo milk 500,00

Full payback in 2 years

We have an old family dairy farm, the farm has been in the family since 1660 and we bought the farm form my wife’s parents in 1982.

We have 530 cows, Holstein and 458 erlands.

We have used Fair Farm Technologies for the last 5 ½ years, it’s been very good, it’s a very good system. The last 8 months we have tested a new system for Fair Farm, CattleWatch. We are one of five herds in Europe that has this new system.

The new system in my opinion

You can have a lot of information in the CattleWatch system. You can see how long the cows are lying down, how many hours they are walking around, and you get a sense of how the cow is feeling, it’s welfare. You can see how long the cows are lying down, how many hours they are walking around, and you get a sense of how the cow is feeling. If a cow is lying too long, maybe it is sick. And on my iPhone I can even see which part of the stable she is in.

If I touch cow number 2891 on my iPhone, about 2 seconds later I can see where the cow is.

It will take care of the cow so that I can in my mind have more cows, and also I have a system where I can take care of the cows, because on my farm I’m aiming to have 1000 cows in five years.

So we must have a system to help me. To take care of the cow and this new system, it’s much better than the old system we have.

I can on the computer see where the cow sits down in the different parts of the stable. If you can help the cows two days earlier, they are not so sick and easier to treat. That is very important information. If you can help the cows two days before, it is money. A cow that is not so sick is easier to treat

You can see in the system when a cow is beginning to be not so happy. It can tell me two days before I can see it with my eyes

You can see in the system when a cow is beginning to be not so happy. It’s very important that  you can see on the system before you can see with your eyes. The system can tell me two days before I can see with my eyes. So it’s a very important information the system can give me.

Of course it will save money, because when you can handle two days before you normally would do it, if you can help the cows two days before, it’s money, because the cow, not being so sick, is easier to treat. It’s more money for the farmers when you llearn to use the system.

You cannot run the farm today like you did 30 years ago.

The prices are lower, the costs are higher. You need help to keep the cows healthy and the farm profitable.

When you learn and trust the system it is a very good help for managing your herd. It can save money, and it makes it possible to look after more cows.

To do that, you must have a system to help you take care of the animals. This new one is much better than the old system

You have to learn to use the system. You need to trust the system.

When you learn and trust the system it’s very good help for the management of your herd.

It’s very difficult to learn. I tried to do it slowly.

It’s middle to good soil we have.

On the fields we grow maize, wheat and grass.

I like to see everything is growing. I like to see my employees

We have

For us we have 8 employees, it’s very important for me to see

We want to be in the ten per cent

I can see things growing and I can also my employments are growing.

If this helps my cows stay healthier and my farm stay alive, then it matters. We cannot afford to stand still
