1. **Objective &amp; Scope of This SOP**

Purpose: To standardize how project-impacting changes (timelines, scope, deliverables, or budget) are submitted, reviewed, approved, and tracked across cross-functional teams.

Scope: Applies to all nonclinical R&amp;D, tech ops, QA, manufacturing, and program management projects that involve internal milestones, CRO vendors, or client deliverables.

*Note: You may include this directly in the SOP’s “Purpose and Scope” section.*

1. **Change Criteria – When Does This SOP Apply?**

This table helps determine when a project adjustment requires formal change control. It is used to quickly assess whether an update is significant enough to trigger the SOP.

| Triggers Change Control                                        | Does NOT Trigger SOP                            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Timeline shift >2 business days for a milestone or deliverable | Rescheduling of internal meetings               |
| Addition/removal of study (e.g. adding a tox timepoint)        | Minor wording change in presentation            |
| Budget overage > $5,000                                        | Cost-neutral reallocation of team time          |
| Scope adjustment affecting contract or CRO                     | Internal scope trade-offs between departments   |
| Document change that affects regulatory submission             | Drafting supporting docs not included in filing |

1. **Roles &amp; Stakeholders – RACI Table**

This matrix is used to define which functions are responsible, accountable, consulted, or informed at each stage of the change control process.

Definitions:

R – Responsible: The person/team doing the work

A – Accountable: The person/team who makes the final decision or approval

C – Consulted: Stakeholders whose input is required before a decision

I – Informed: Stakeholders who are notified after a decision or action

| Function             | Initiate Change   | Review Impact   | Approve Change   | Track Status   |
|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Project Management   | R                 | A               | A                | R              |
| QA                   | C                 | R               | A                | C              |

| Tech Ops             | C                 | R               | C                | C              |
| Finance              | C                 | R               | A (if cost)      | C              |
| Regulatory           | C                 | R (if filing)   | A (if filing)    | I              |
| Client (if external) | C                 | C               | A (if relevant)  | I              |

**3A. Change Request Form**

Include a Word or Excel form template with the following fields:

| Field                    | Description                                               |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Change ID                | Unique request identifier                                 |
| Client Name              | Project/Program this applies to                           |
| Requestor                | Name of individual initiating the change                  |
| Date Submitted           | Date of form completion                                   |
| Description of Change    | Summary of requested change                               |
| Affected Functions       | QA, QC, Manufacturing, BD, Facilities, Regulatory, others |
| Timeline Impact          | Y/N and detail                                            |
| Budget Impact            | Y/N and estimate                                          |
| Filing/Compliance Impact | Y/N and explanation                                       |

| Final Status             | Approved / Rejected / Escalated                           |

**3B. Change Log Tracker (Excel)**

Include a centralized tracker for logging all change requests. Sample columns:

| Change ID   | Project   | Date Submitted   | Requestor   | Summary   | Risk Level   | Status   | Outcome   | Last Updated By   | Date Closed   |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|

**3C. Document Management and Ownership**

Clarify:

- Where the tracker is stored (e.g., SharePoint, Smartsheet)
- Where the signed forms are archived
- Who owns the maintenance of the log

1. **Approval Sequence (Logic Flow)**

Base flowchart for medium/high impact changes:

PM submits form → QA reviews → Tech Ops reviews → Finance reviews (if budget) → Regulatory reviews (if filing impact) → Final PM Lead signoff → Entry into tracker and archive

Low-risk changes that do not impact timelines, scope, budget, or compliance—such as minor corrections or 1-day adjustments—can be fast-tracked. These require only joint approval from the Project Manager and QA and must still be logged for audit purposes, but do not go through the full review process.

1. **Audit Readiness Expectations**

Make this explicit in the SOP:

- Every change request must be timestamped
- Approvals must be recorded in writing (email, signature, electronic log)
- All supporting documents should be version controlled
- The final status of the change must be logged and traceable
- The tracker must be reviewable by internal QA or external auditors for compliance

1. **Formatting Expectations for SOP (if applicable)**

To match other SOPs in your organization:

- Font: Calibri 11pt
- Line spacing: 1.15
- Required Sections:
    - Purpose
    - Scope
    - Definitions (optional)
    - Roles &amp; Responsibilities
    - Procedure (numbered steps)
    - Change Criteria Table
    - Approval Logic
    - Document Storage / Audit
    - Version History Table (at end)
