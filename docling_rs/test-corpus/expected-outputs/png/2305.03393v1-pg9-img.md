We have chosen the PubTabNet data setto perform HPO.sinceit includes a.
highly diyerse set oftables. Also we report'l'FlDscores separately for slmple and
complex ta.bles(tables with cellspans). Results are presented in Table.iilIt is

We pickedthe modelparameterconfiguiration that produced the best prediction
qualitv(enc=6.dec=6. heads=8） with PubTabNet alone.then independently
trained and evaluated it on three publicly available data sets: PublabNet 395k
Samples). FinTa.bNet (113k samples）and Pub'Tables-1M (about 1M sam ples).
Performanceresultsarepresentedin Table.2lItisclearlyeyidentthatthe model
trained on O'T'Sl outperforms HTM l acrossthe board.keeping high'T'E Dsand
m A P scores even on difh cilt hnanclal tables (Fin'IabNet） that contain sparse
and largetables.
Additionally.the results show that OT'Sl, has an adyantage over H' Ml,
when applied on a bigger data setlike PubTa.bles-TM and achievessignificantly
improved scores.Finallv. Q'I'SL achievesfasterinference due to fewer decoding
steps which 1s a resuilt ofthe reduced seouence representation.
