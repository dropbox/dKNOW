Welcome to our technical presentation on distributed systems.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,800
Today we'll discuss three key concepts:
consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,000
These are the foundations of the CAP theorem,
which states that you can only achieve two out of three.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,200
First, let's examine consistency.
In a distributed system, consistency means
all nodes see the same data at the same time.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,500
Next, availability ensures that every request
receives a response about whether it succeeded or failed.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,800
Finally, partition tolerance means the system
continues to operate despite network failures.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,000
Understanding these trade-offs is crucial
for designing robust distributed systems.
