[Narrator] The Amazon rainforest is home to
approximately 400 billion individual trees.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,500
These trees represent about 16,000 different species,
making it the most biodiverse forest ecosystem on Earth.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,800
However, deforestation threatens this incredible habitat.
Every minute, an area equivalent to 40 football fields is lost.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,200
Scientists estimate that 17% of the Amazon
has been destroyed in the last 50 years.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,500
The consequences extend far beyond the forest itself.
The Amazon produces 20% of the world's oxygen
and stores massive amounts of carbon dioxide.

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,000
Indigenous communities, who have lived in harmony
with the forest for thousands of years,
are also under threat.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,500
Conservation efforts are underway, but they require
global cooperation and immediate action
to preserve this vital ecosystem for future generations.
