## Detailed Project Description and Justification:

To curb costs and eliminate potentially dangerous travel conditions for our students, Cordova School recently moved from one conference to another.  Less airlines travel, more ferry travel resulting in less school time missed and less cost to our student travel budget.  We still need to get from the ferry terminal to the hosting school.  This van would be used for this purpose. Our students would use this in the required academic travel as well as the numerous athletic travel needs.
