<h2>NON-CRIMINAL JUSTICE APPLICANT'S PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
<p>As an applicant that is the subject of a Georgia only or a Georgia and Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI) national fingerprint/biometric-based criminal history record check for a non-criminal justic urpose (such as an application for a job or license, immigration or naturalization, security clearance or adoption), you have certain rights which are discussed below.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">You must be provided written notification that your fingerprints/biometrics will be used to check the criminal history records maintained by the Georgia Crime Information Center (GCIC) and the FBI, when a federal record check is so authorized.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">If your fingerprints/biometrics are used to conduct a FBI national criminal history check, you are provided a copy of the Privacy Act Statement that would normally appear on the FBI fingerprint card.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">If you have a criminal history record, the agency making a determination of your suitability for the job, license, or other benefit must provide you the opportunity to complete or challenge the accuracy of the information in the record.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">The agency must advise you of the procedures for changing, correcting, or updating your criminal history record as set forth in Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Section 16.34.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">If you have a Georgia or FBI criminal history record, you should be afforded a reasonable amount of time to correct or complete the record (or decline to do so) before the agency denies you the job, license or other benefit based on information in the criminal history record</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">In the event an adverse employment or licensing decision is made, you must be informed of all information pertinent to that decision to include the contents of the record and the effect the record had upon the decision. Failure to provide all such information to the person subject to the adverse decision shall be a misdemeanor [O.C.G.A. § 35-3-34(b) and §35-3-35 (b)].</li>
</ul>
<p>You have the right to expect the agency receiving the results of the criminal history record check will use it only for authorized purposes and will not retain or disseminate it in violation of state and/or federal statute, regulation or executive order, or rule, procedure or standard established by the National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact Council.</p>
<p>If the employment/licensing agency policy permits, the agency may provide you with a copy of your Georgia or FBI criminal history record for review and possible challenge. If agency policy does not vermit it to provide you a copy of the record, information regarding how to obtain a copy of your Georgia, FBI or other state criminal history may be obtained at the GBI website</p>
<p>(http://nLgeorgia.goviobtanung-criminal-history-record-information)</p>
<p>If you decide to challenge the accuracy or completeness of your Georgia or FBI criminal history record, you should send your challenge to the agency that contributed the questioned information. Alternatively, you may send your challenge directly to GCIC provided the disputed arrest occurred in Georgia. Instructions to dispute the accuracy of your criminal history can be obtained at the GBI website (http://gbi.georgia.gov/obtaining-criminal-history-record-information)</p>
