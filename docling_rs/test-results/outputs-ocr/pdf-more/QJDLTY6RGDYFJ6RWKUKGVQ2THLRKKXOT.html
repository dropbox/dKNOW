<h2>Yavapa ai County y Finance e Departm ment</h2>
<p>The independent audit of the financial statements of the County was part of a broader, federally mandated 'Single Audit' designed to meet the special needs of federal grantor agencies.  The standards governing Single Audit engagements require the independent auditor to report not only on the fair presentation of the financial statements, but also on the audited government's internal controls and compliance with legal requirements, with special emphasis on internal controls and legal requirements involving the administration of federal awards.  These reports are available in the County's separately issued Single Audit report.</p>
<p>GAAP  require  that  management  provide  a  narrative  introduction,  overview,  and  analysis  to accompany the basic financial statements in the form of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A).  This letter of transmittal  is  designed  to  complement  the  MD&amp;A  and  should  be  read  in conjunction  with  it.    The  County's  MD&amp;A  can  be  found  immediately  following  the  report  of  the independent auditors.</p>
<h2>Profile of the Government</h2>
<p>Yavapai County was formed in 1864; one year after the Arizona Territory was established.  The County was named after the Yavapai tribe, whose name means 'people of the sun'.  The County is located in the central portion of the state encompassing approximately 8,125 square miles.</p>
<p>The County is empowered to levy a property tax on both real and personal properties within its boundaries.</p>
<p>The County operates under the supervisor-administrator form of government.  Policy-making and legislative  authority  are  vested  in  a  Board  of  Supervisors  (Board)  consisting  of  five  members elected  to  four-year  terms  representing  five  supervisorial  districts.    The  Board  appoints  an Administrator,  who  is  responsible  for  developing  and  presenting  the  County  budget,  assisting department heads and elected officials, and coordinating with other governments in intergovernmental relations.</p>
<p>The  Board  is  responsible  for  the  financing  and  administration  of  County  government,  has  final approval  over  County  departmental  budgets  and  sets  property  tax  rates.    As  part  of  its administrative duties, the Board is responsible for appointing department heads, and members of County  boards  and  commissions  dealing  with  planning  and  zoning,  building  codes,  health, employees and employee benefits, private industry and agriculture.  The Board acts as the board of directors for special districts within the County such as jail, water, sanitation, lighting, flood control and library.</p>
<p>In addition to the Board, other elected officers representing the County include the Assessor, Clerk of  the  Superior  Court,  County  Attorney,  Recorder,  School  Superintendent,  Sheriff,  and  the Treasurer.  There are seven elected Superior Court Judges, five Justices of the Peace, and four Constables.</p>
<p>Yavapai  County  provides  a  full  range  of  services,  including  police  protection,  courts,  health services,  elections,  the  construction  and  maintenance  of  highways,  streets, other  infrastructure and parks.</p>
<p>The financial reporting entity includes all the funds of the primary government (Yavapai County), as well as its component units.  Component units are legally separate entities for which the primary government  is  financially  accountable.    The  Board  acts  as  the  Board  of  Directors  of  these component  units.    Accordingly,  the  Yavapai  County  Flood  Control  District,  Library  District,  Jail District and various special assessment districts are reported as a part of the governmental fund types of the primary government.</p>
<p>There  are  various  school  districts,  special  districts,  and  fire  districts  within  Yavapai  County governed by independently elected  boards.    The  financial  statements  of  such  districts  are  not included  in  this  report  except  to  reflect  amounts  held  in  an  agency  capacity  by  the  County Treasurer.  The reporting entity is further described in Note 1 to the financial statements.</p>
<p>The annual budget serves as the foundation for the County's financial planning and control.  All departments  of  the  County  are  required  to  submit  requests  for  appropriation  to  the  County Administrator annually.  These requests are used as the starting point for developing a proposed budget.    The  County  Administrator  then  presents  this  proposed  budget  to  the  Board  of Supervisors for review on or before the third Monday in July.   On or before the fourteenth day before  the  day  in  August  when  the  Board  sets  tax  levy  rates,  the  Board  must  hold  a  public hearing and a special meeting of the Board, at which time the final budget must be adopted.  The final budget is adopted by fund and department.  Transfers of appropriations between funds or departments require approval of the Board.  Budget-to-actual comparisons are provided in this report for each individual governmental fund for which an appropriated annual budget has been adopted.  For the general fund and major special revenue funds this comparison is presented beginning on page 59 as part of the required supplemental information.  For governmental funds, other than the general fund and major special revenue funds with appropriated annual budgets, this comparison is presented in the governmental fund subsection of this report, which starts on page 82.</p>
<h2>Local Economy</h2>
<p>Yavapai County's population increased from 211,033 in 2010 to 216,057 (estimate) in 2014 according to the Arizona Department of Administration, Office of Employment and Population Statistics, which is a 2.4% increase as compared to the State of Arizona population  increase  of  4.0%  for  the  same  time period.  Yavapai County has a higher percentage, 27.1%, of persons over the age of 65 as compared to the State of Arizona with 15.3%.  This indicates that a greater segment of the population is retired, which provides a more stable consumer base.</p>
<p>Yavapai County, as many other counties in  the  State  of  Arizona,  continues  to  experience  very  little increase in real estate values.  As a result, property tax collections for fiscal year 2013-14 were flat, showing no increase when compared to fiscal year 2012-13.  Despite this, the population is growing and we anticipate our sales tax revenues to trend slowly upward.</p>
<p>The  Arizona  Department  of  Administration,  Office  of  Employment  and  Population  Statistics estimates a 6.7% average 2014 unemployment rate for Yavapai County.  Yavapai County is the single largest employer in Yavapai County, with Yavapai County Regional Medical Center as the second largest employer.</p>
<p>Retail trade, tourism, utilities, healthcare, warehouse and distribution centers, mining, light industry and government all contribute to the economy.</p>
<h2>Long-Term Financial Planning</h2>
<p>In November of 1999, the Yavapai County Jail District was formed when the citizens approved a dedicated excise tax of up to 1/4 cent for the purpose of constructing, operating, maintaining and financing  County  jail  facilities.      In  December  of  1999,  the  Board  adopted  Resolution  No.1999-1 establishing the initial excise tax of 1/5 cent.  On March 26, 2003, the excise tax was raised to the voter approved rate of 1/4 cent.</p>
<p>The excise tax was used to construct an expansion of the jail facilities to increase the size of the Camp  Verde  jail  facility  by  480  beds  and  was  completed  in  the  fall  of  2003.    Total  cost  was approximately  $20.0  million.      Pledged  revenue  obligations  in  the  amount  of  $15.3  million  were issued to finance the majority of the construction costs.  The final payment for this debt obligation was paid at the end of fiscal year 2011-12.</p>
<p>The Jail District sales tax and the maintenance of effort from the General Fund are inadequate to fund  the  operation  of  the  Jail  District.    The  Board  asked  the  voters  of  Yavapai  County  in  the November 4, 2014, general election for authorization to extend the life of the tax and to increase the Jail District sales tax rate from ¼ cent to ½ cent however, this request was voted down.  Because the  operation  of  a  county  jail  facility  is  statutorily  required,  other  resources  will  continue  to  be diverted at the direction of the Board in order to fund the operation of the Jail District.</p>
<p>In May 2008, the Board entered into a $50 million capital lease agreement to finance the design and construction of a Superior Court building next to the Camp Verde jail facility, a Juvenile Justice Center and two administrative buildings in Prescott.  The Board modified this lease agreement and retired  $25  million  of  the  original  $50  million.    Because  of  the  economic  environment  and  the modification  of  the  lease  agreement,  the  Board  eliminated  the  construction  of  the  administrative buildings from the original plan.  The Superior Court building was completed in fiscal year 2009-10 and the Juvenile Justice Center was completed in fiscal year 2012-13.</p>
<h2>Relevant Financial Policies</h2>
<p>Traditionally,  the  Board  has  managed  the  County  in  a  fiscally  conservative  environment  with  a primary  goal  to  minimize  the  County  property  tax  rate  and  to  operate  within  the  tax  revenues received during the fiscal year.  The Board has delegated the responsibility to monitor revenues and  to  make  recommendations  when  necessary  to  maintain  fiscal  discipline  to  the  County Administrator.</p>
<p>During the past five fiscal years, the Board has enacted several measures to manage the declining revenues.  County departments reduced expenditures in fiscal year 2009-10 by 7.5% and for the next  four  fiscal  years  departments  were  held  the  same  expenditure  level  as  the  previous  fiscal year.    As  revenue  continues  to  improve,  the  Board  has  appropriated  funds  to  replace  obsolete vehicles and computer replacement budgets.</p>
<h2>Awards and Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) awarded a  Certificate  of  Achievement  for  Excellence  in  Financial  Reporting  to  Yavapai  County  for  its comprehensive annual financial report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013.  In order to be awarded  a  Certificate  of  Achievement,  a  government  must  publish  an  easily  readable  and efficiently  organized  comprehensive  annual  financial  report.    This  report  must  satisfy  both generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>A Certificate of Achievement is valid for a period of one year only.    We believe that our current comprehensive  annual  financial  report  continues  to  meet  the  Certificate  of  Achievement Program's  requirements  and  we  are  submitting  it  to  the  GFOA  to  determine  its  eligibility  for another certificate.</p>
<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>The preparation of this report could only be accomplished through the efforts of the staff of the Finance Department and the assistance of the Arizona State Auditor General's Office. We also wish to thank the Board of Supervisors for their dedicated oversight of the financial condition of the County and their support for our efforts to improve its financial operations.</p>

We conducted our audit in accordance with U.S. generally accepted auditing standards and the standards applicable to financial  audits  contained  in Government Auditing  Standards, issued  by  the  Comptroller  General  of  the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.</p>
<p>An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditors consider internal control relevant to the County's preparation and fair presentation  of  the  financial  statements  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the County's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made  by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.</p>
<p>We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.</p>
<p>MELANIE M. CHESNEY</p>
<p>DEPUTY AUDITOR GENERAL</p>
<h2>Opinions</h2>
<p>In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the governmental activities, each major fund, and aggregate remaining fund information of Yavapai County as of June 30, 2014, and the respective changes in financial position for the year then ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<h2>Emphasis of Matter</h2>
<p>As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, for the year ended June 30, 2014, the County adopted new accounting guidance, Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 65. Our opinions are not modified with respect to this matter.</p>
<p>As  described  in  Note  13  to  the  financial  statements,  the  County  restated  beginning  net  position/fund balances  of  its  financial  statements  for  the  year  ended  June  30,  2014,  to  correct  misstatements  in  its previously issued financial statements. Our opinions are not modified with respect to this matter.</p>
<h2>Other Matters</h2>
<h2>Required Supplementary Information</h2>
<p>U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that the Management's Discussion and Analysis on pages 13 through 20, the Budgetary Comparison Schedules on pages 59 through 64, and the Schedule of Agent  Retirement  Plans'  Funding  Progress  on  page  65  and  66  be  presented  to  supplement  the  basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with U.S. generally accepted auditing standards, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.</p>
<h2>Other Information</h2>
<p>Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise  the  County's  basic  financial  statements.  The  combining  and  individual  fund  statements  and schedules and the introductory and statistical sections listed in the table of  contents are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not required parts of the basic financial statements.</p>
<p>The combining and individual fund statements and schedules are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit  of  the  basic  financial  statements  and  certain  additional  procedures,  including  comparing  and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted auditing standards. In our opinion, the combining and individual fund statements and schedules are fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>0</p>
<p>The introductory and statistical sections have not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit  of  the  basic  financial  statements,  and  accordingly,  we  do  not  express  an  opinion  or  provide  any assurance on them.</p>
<h2>Compliance Over the Use of Highway User Revenue Fund and Other Dedicated State Transportation Revenue Monies</h2>
<p>In connection with our audit, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that the County failed to use highway user revenue fund monies received by the County pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes Title 28, Chapter 18, Article 2, and any other dedicated state transportation revenues received by the County solely for the authorized transportation purposes, insofar as they relate to accounting matters. However, our audit was not directed primarily toward obtaining knowledge of such noncompliance. Accordingly, had we performed additional procedures, other matters may have come to our attention regarding the County's noncompliance with the use of highway user revenue fund monies and other dedicated state transportation revenues, insofar as they relate to accounting matters.</p>
<p>The communication related to compliance over the use of highway user revenue fund and other dedicated state transportation revenue monies in the preceding paragraph is intended solely for the information and use of the members of the Arizona State Legislature, the Board of Supervisors, management, and other responsible parties within the County and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.</p>
<h2>Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards</h2>
<p>In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we will issue our report on our consideration of the County's internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters at a future date. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the County's internal control over financial reporting and compliance.</p>

<h2>Overview of the Financial Statements</h2>
<p>This  discussion  and  analysis  is  intended  to  serve  as  an  introduction  to  Yavapai  County's  basic  financial statements.  Yavapai County's basic financial statements are comprised of three components: 1) governmentwide financial statements, 2) fund financial statements and 3) notes to the financial statements.  This report also contains other supplementary information in addition to the basic financial statements themselves.</p>
<p>Government-wide financial statements .  The  government-wide financial statements are designed to provide readers with a broad overview of Yavapai County's finances, in a manner similar to a private sector business.</p>
<p>The  statement  of  net  position presents  information  on  all  of  Yavapai  County's  assets  and  liabilities,  with  the difference  between  the  two  reported  as  net  position.    Over  time,  increases  or  decreases  in  net  position  may serve as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of Yavapai County is improving or deteriorating.</p>
<p>The statement of activities presents information showing how the government's net position changed during the most recent fiscal year.  All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the change occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows.  Thus, revenues and expenses are reported in this statement for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected taxes and earned but unused paid-time-off leave).</p>
<p>Both of  the  government-wide  financial  statements  distinguish  functions  of  Yavapai  County  that  are  principally supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues (governmental activities).  The governmental activities of Yavapai  County  include  general  government,  public  safety,  highways  and  streets,  sanitation,  health,  welfare, culture and recreation, and education.</p>
<p>The  government-wide  financial  statements  not  only  include  Yavapai  County  itself  (known  as  the  primary government), but also a legally separate Jail District, Flood Control District, Library District and various Special Assessment Districts.  These districts function for all practical purposes as departments of Yavapai County, and therefore have been included as an integral part of the primary government.</p>
<h2>Yavapai County Management's Discussion and Analysis</h2>
<p>The government-wide financial statements can be found on pages 22 - 23 of this report.</p>
<p>Fund  financial  statements. A  fund  is  a  grouping  of  related  accounts  that  is  used  to  maintain  control  over resources that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives.  Yavapai County, like other state and local  governments , uses  fund  accounting  to  ensure  and  demonstrate  compliance  with  finance  related legal  requirements.    All  of  the  funds  of  Yavapai  County  can  be  divided  into  two  categories:  governmental funds and fiduciary funds.</p>
<p>Governmental funds. Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions reported as governmental  activities  in  the  government-wide  financial  statements.    However,  unlike  the  government-wide financial  statements,  the  governmental  funds  financial  statements  focus  on  near-term inflows  and  outflows  of spendable resources,  as  well  as  on  balances  of  spendable  resources  available  at  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year. Such information may be useful in evaluating a government's near-term financial requirements.</p>
<p>Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial statements, it is useful  to  compare  the  information  presented  for  governmental  funds  with  similar  information  presented  for governmental  activities  in  the  government-wide  financial  statements.    By  doing  so,  readers  may  better understand  the  long-term  impact  of  the  government's  near  term  financing  decisions.    Both  the  governmental funds  balance  sheet  and  the  governmental  funds  statement  of  revenues,  expenditures,  and  changes  in  fund balances provide a reconciliation to facilitate  this  comparison  between  governmental  funds  and  governmental activities.</p>
<p>Yavapai County maintains numerous individual governmental funds.  Information is presented separately in the governmental  funds  balance  sheet  and  in  the  governmental  funds  statement  of  revenues,  expenditures,  and changes in fund balances for seven funds considered  to be major funds.  Data from the other  governmental funds  are  combined  into  a  single,  aggregated  presentation.  Individual  fund  data  for  each  of  these  non-major governmental funds is provided in the form of combining statements elsewhere in this report.</p>
<p>The basic governmental fund financial statements can be found on pages 24 - 30 of this report.</p>
<p>Fiduciary Funds. Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government.  Fiduciary  funds  are  not reflected  in  the  government-wide  financial  statements  because  the resources of those funds are not available to support Yavapai County's own programs.  The accounting used for fiduciary funds is much like that used for proprietary funds.</p>
<p>The basic fiduciary funds financial statements can be found on pages 31 - 32 of this report.</p>
<p>Notes  to  the  financial  statements. The  notes  provide  additional  information  that  is  essential  to  the  full understanding  of  the  data  provided  in  the  government-wide  and  fund  financial  statements.    The  notes  to  the financial statements can be found on pages 33 - 58 of this report.</p>
<p>Other  information. In  addition  to  the  basic  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes,  this  report  also presents  certain  required  supplementary  information  concerning  Yavapai  County's  progress  in  funding  its obligation to provide pension benefits to its employees and budgetary comparison schedules for the general fund and major special revenue funds.  Other required supplementary information can be found on pages 59 - 66 of this report.</p>
<p>The combining statements referred to earlier in connection with non-major governmental funds are presented immediately  following  the  required  supplementary  information.  Combining  and  individual  fund  statements  and schedules can be found on pages 70 - 107 of this report.</p>
<h2>Government-wide Financial Analysis</h2>
<p>Net Position. As noted earlier, net position may serve over time as a useful indicator of a government's financial position.  Yavapai  County's  assets  exceeded  liabilities  by  $308.6  million  at  the  close  of  the  most  recent  fiscal year.</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td></td><th colspan="2">Net Position (in millions)</th></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><th>2014 2013 (as restated)</th></tr><tr><th>Current and other assets</th><td></td><td>80.0 $ 81.7</td></tr><tr><th>Capital assets</th><td></td><td>268.8 271.5</td></tr><tr><th>Total assets</th><td></td><td>348.8 353.2</td></tr><tr><th>Long-term liabilities outstanding</th><td></td><td>32.3 33.8</td></tr><tr><th>Other liabilities</th><td></td><td>7.9 11.5</td></tr><tr><th>Total liabilities</th><td></td><td>40.2 45.3</td></tr><tr><th>Net position:</th><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><th>Net investment in capital assets</th><td></td><td>244.9 246.3</td></tr><tr><th>Restricted</th><td></td><td>29.4 29.2</td></tr><tr><th>Unrestricted</th><td></td><td>34.3 32.4</td></tr><tr><th>Total net position</th><td></td><td>308.6 $ 307.9</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The largest  portion  of  Yavapai  County's  net  positon  (79%)  reflects  its  investment  in  capital  assets  (e.g.  land, buildings, equipment, infrastructure, software, construction in progress), less accumulated depreciation and any related  outstanding debt used to acquire those assets.  Yavapai County uses these capital assets to provide services  to  citizens;  consequently,  these  assets  are  not  available  for  future  spending.    Although  Yavapai County's investment in its capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources, since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities.</p>
<p>Governmental Activities current and other assets decreased $1.7 million from the previous year.  This decrease is primarily the result of normal variation in the timing of paying expenses during the fiscal year.  Capital assets decreased $2.7 million because the decrease in asset value from depreciation was larger than the increase in asset value from new acquisitions.</p>
<p>Governmental Activities long-term liabilities decreased $1.5 million from the previous fiscal year due to payments for special assessment bonds and capital leases.</p>
<p>Governmental Activities other liabilities  decreased  $3.6  million  primarily  due  to  the  timing  of  paying  expenses which decreased accounts payable $2.3 million.</p>
<p>Yavapai County's Governmental Activities restricted net position of $29.4 million represents resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be used.  This amount has changed very little from the previous year.</p>
<p>The Governmental Activities unrestricted net position increased $1.9 million from the previous fiscal year.  This increase  is  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  the  collection  of  State  shared  sales  taxes.    The  Governmental Activities  unrestricted  net  position  balance  of  $34.3  million  may  be  used  to  meet  the  government's  ongoing obligations to citizens and creditors.</p>
<p>At  the  end  of  the  current  fiscal  year,  Yavapai  County  reports  positive  balances  in  all  three  categories,  net investment  in  capital  assets  $244.9  million,  restricted  net  position  $29.4  million  and  unrestricted  net  position $34.3 million.</p>
<p>Changes in Net Position. The statement of activities presents information showing how the government's net position changed during the most recent fiscal year.  For the fiscal year, net position increased $0.7 million.  The basis  of  accounting  used  in  the  government-wide  statement  of  activities  excludes  capital  outlay  while  its revenues include taxes that are used, in part, for the construction of those assets.</p>

<h2>Yavapai County Management's Discussion and Analysis</h2>
<p>Governmental activities. Governmental  Activities  revenues  totaled  $168.8  million  for  fiscal  year  2014.    The following are highlights of County revenues:</p>
<ul>
<li> Sales taxes are comprised of state shared-sales tax, a 0.5% County excise tax and a 0.25% Jail District excise tax.  Overall sales tax decreased $0.9 million from the previous fiscal year, this is primarily due to the one time effect of the restatement discussed in Note 13 on page 58.</li>
<li> Capital  grants  increased  by  $1.3  million  from  the  previous  year,  because  of  the  amounts  due  and collectible from the special assessments of the improvement districts.</li>
<li> Operating  grants  and  contributions  increased  by  $1.2  million  from  the  previous  year,  because  of  the State contributions to the repair and maintenance of roadways.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Yavapai County Management's Discussion and Analysis</h2>
<h2>Expenses</h2>
<p>Governmental activities expenses decreased $1.7 million from the previous fiscal year.  Public Safety increased $0.6 million from the previous year due to increased depreciation expenses.  Highways and streets declined $1.6 million due to decreased depreciation and decreased expenses for repairs.  Education decreased $0.8 million from the previous year due to reduction of expenses in the Detention School.</p>
<p>As  noted  earlier,  Yavapai  County  uses  fund  accounting  to  ensure  and  demonstrate  compliance  with  finance related legal requirements.</p>
<p>Governmental funds .    The  focus  of  Yavapai  County's governmental funds is to provide information on nearterm inflows, outflows, and balances of spendable resources.  Such information is useful in assessing Yavapai County's financing requirements.  In particular, unassigned fund balance may serve as a useful measure of a government's net resources available for spending at the end of the fiscal year.</p>
<p>As of the end of the current fiscal year, Yavapai County's governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of $69,205,917, which is an increase of $268,442 from the restated prior year balance.  The ending fund balances are categorized as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li> Committed $29,500,387</li>
<li> Nonspendable $903,437</li>
<li> Restricted $29,214,659</li>
<li> Unassigned $9,587,434</li>
</ul>
<p>While the total fund balance changed by only 0.4%, the unassigned balances increased by $1,119,748, or 13%, and this change is primarily due to General Fund activity.</p>
<h2>Yavapai County Management's Discussion and Analysis</h2>
<p>The  General  Fund  is  the  chief  operating  fund  of  Yavapai  County.    At  the  end  of  the  current  fiscal  year,  the General  Fund  total  fund  balance  was  $10,250,797,  and  the  unassigned  category  was  $9,716,724.    The unassigned category is $1,249,038 more than the previous fiscal year as restated.  This increase is due to an increase in collections from State shared sales tax activity.</p>
<p>In addition to the General Fund, Yavapai County is reporting six major funds.  These funds are the Jail District, Regional Road, HURF Road, Capital Projects, Capital Projects Debt Service, and Poquito Valley Debt Service.</p>
<p>The Jail District fund balance increased $228,501 in accordance with the adopted budget.  The Regional Road fund balance increased $869,242 because of decreases in the construction of road projects.  The HURF Road fund balance increased $2.2 million because of the decrease in roadway expenditures.  Capital Projects fund balance  decreased  $2.1  million  because  of  capital  projects  such  as  the  Courthouse  restoration  project.    The Capital  Projects  Debt  Service  fund  balance  remains  relatively  unchanged  from  the  prior  fiscal  year,  and  the Poquito Valley Debt Service fund balance increased slightly due to ongoing collections of its special assessment.</p>
<p>See Note 8 on pages 48 - 49 for a detail listing of the fund balance classifications.</p>
<h2>General Fund Budgetary Highlights</h2>
<p>The original General Fund budget appropriation for expenditures was $89,679,704.  Actual expenditures were $4,498,928 less than the final budgeted appropriation amount, which is primarily due to departments monitoring and controlling expenditures.  The Board approved budgeted transfers between departments during the fiscal year  to  reclassify  expenditures  and  for  departments  that  required  an  increase  in  budget  appropriation.    The departments , that  required  a  budget  transfer  were  Public  Defender  ($862,619),  Facilities  ($58,632),  Board of  Supervisors ( $ 39,500), Fleet ($15,576), and Bagdad/Yarnell Justice of the Peace  ($3,559), for a combined  transfer of $979,886 from General Services.  The final total General Fund budgeted appropriation of $89,679,704 remained  unchanged.    The  General  Services  expenditure  budget  includes  negative  amounts  for internal  cost  recoveries,  such  as  vehicle  use  and  indirect  costs,  which  resulted  in  actual  expenditures  of negative $779,870 and a variance below the final budget of $1.4 million.</p>
<p>Total  revenues  were $1.6 million over total budgeted revenues (1.7%), which is primarily due to greater than anticipated  collections  ($0.5  million)  of  voluntary  exchange  transactions  categorized  as  permit  revenue.    In addition the County collected intergovernmental revenue, shared State sales taxes, in an amount that was ($0.7 million) greater than budgeted.</p>
<h2>Capital Asset and Debt Administration</h2>
<p>Capital  Assets. Yavapai  County's  investment  in  capital  assets  for  its  governmental  activities  as  of  June  30, 2014, amounts to $268.8 million (net of accumulated depreciation).  This investment in capital assets includes land,  buildings,  equipment,  infrastructure,  software  and  construction  in  progress.    In  addition,  roads  and highways constructed in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, or in progress at that date, are included in capital assets.  Infrastructure increased due to the completion of roadway projects.  Construction in progress decreased $6.6 million due to completion of planned capital projects.</p>

<p>Additional information on Yavapai County's capital assets can be found in Note 5 on page 43 of this report.</p>
<p>Long-term  Debt. At  the  end  of  the  current  fiscal  year,  Yavapai  County  had  total  outstanding  bonds  of $2,120,000 for special district road improvements.  These bonds are secured by property assessments levied against the benefiting property owners.</p>
<table><tbody><tr><th>Yavapai County&#x27;s Outstanding Bonds (in millions)</th><th>2014</th><td></td></tr><tr><th>Special Assessment Debt Payable</th><td>$ 2.1</td><td>$ 2.3</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>State statutes limit the amount of general obligation debt a county may issue to 6 percent of its total assessed valuation.    The  current  debt  limitation  for  the  County  is  $133,957,776.    Since  the  County  has  no  general obligation debt, this amount equals the debt capacity.  Additional information on long-term debt can be found in Note 7 on pages 44 - 45.</p>
<p>Long-term  Capital  Lease. On  May  15,  2008,  the  County  entered  into  a  long  term  lease  agreement  in  the amount of $50 million for a period of twenty years with an interest rate of 4.45%.  The lease agreement was renegotiated in June 2009 for $25 million and is secured by a ground lease for the construction of the Camp Verde Superior Court and the Juvenile Justice Center.  As of June 30, 2014, the outstanding lease balance is $21.8 million.</p>
<h2>Economic Factors and Next Year's Budgets and Rates</h2>
<ul>
<li> The unemployment rate for Yavapai County is currently 6.7%, which has decreased since 2013.</li>
<li> The economy at the national and state level is anticipated to have the effect of reducing or eliminating Federal and State of Arizona grant programs.</li>
<li> Inflationary trends in the region are comparable to national and the State of Arizona indices.</li>
</ul>
<p>These factors were considered in preparing Yavapai County's budget for the 2014-15 fiscal year.  The budgetary estimate of unassigned ending fund balance in the general fund of $6,523,933 was appropriated for spending in the 2014-15 fiscal year budget.</p>

<p>Yavapai County's accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles  applicable  to  governmental  units  adopted  by  the  Governmental  Accounting Standards Board (GASB).</p>
<p>For  the  year  ended  June  30,  2014,  the  County  implemented  the  provisions  of  GASB Statement No. 65, Items Previously Reported as Assets and Liabilities .  GASB Statement No. 65 reclassifies certain items that were previously reported as assets and liabilities as deferred outflows of resources or deferred inflows of resources and recognizes certain other  items  that  were  previously  reported  as  assets  and  liabilities  as  revenues  or expenses.</p>
<h2>A. Reporting Entity</h2>
<p>The  County  is  a  general  purpose  local  government  that  is  governed  by  a  separately elected  board  of  supervisors.  The  accompanying  financial  statements  present  the activities of the County (the primary government) and its component units.</p>
<p>Component units are legally separate entities for which the County is considered to be financially accountable.  Blended component units, although legally separate entities, are so intertwined with the County that they are in substance part of the County's operations. Therefore,  data  from  these  units  is  combined  with  data  of  the  primary  government. Discretely  presented  component  units,  on  the  other  hand,  are  reported  in  a  separate column  in  the  government-wide  financial  statements  to  emphasize  they  are  legally separate from the County.  Each blended component unit discussed below has a June 30 year-end.  The County has no discretely presented component units.</p>
<p>The following table describes the County's component units:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><th>Component Unit</th><th>Description; Criteria for Inclusion</th><th>Reporting Method</th><th>For Separate Financial Statements</th></tr><tr><td>Yavapai County Flood Control District</td><td>A tax-levying district that provides flood control systems; the County&#x27;s Board of Supervisors serves as the board of directors</td><td>Blended</td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td>Yavapai County Library District</td><td>Provides and maintains library services for the County&#x27;s residents; the County&#x27;s Board of Supervisors serves as the board of directors</td><td>Blended</td><td>Not available</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Related Organizations - The United States Department of Agriculture deeded property to Yavapai County on February 6, 1957 to be used exclusively as a public airport facility. The  property  shall  automatically  revert  to  the  United  States  in  the  event  the  property ceases to be used as a public airport facility.  The Sedona-Oak Creek Airport Authority (Airport Authority) was created for the purpose of developing and promoting transportation  and  commerce  by  air  in  the  State  of  Arizona,  and  in  particular  the development, promotion, and operation of air transportation facilities and air commerce in and around the Sedona area.  In 1971, the Airport Authority entered into a 60-year lease with Yavapai County to manage and operate the Sedona Airport facility, which is owned by the County.  The Airport Authority is governed by a 13 member Board of Directors approved  by  the  County's  Board  of  Supervisors.    However,  the  Airport  Authority's operations  are  completely  separate  from  the  County,  and  the  County  is  not  financially accountable  for  the  Airport  Authority.    Therefore,  based  on  the  criterion  of  GASB Statement Nos. 14, 39, and 61, the financial activities of the Airport Authority have not been included in the accompanying financial statements.</p>
<p>The Industrial Development Authority of Yavapai County (Authority) is a legally separate entity that was created to assist in the financing of commercial and industrial enterprises: safe, sanitary, and affordable housing; and healthcare facilities.  The Authority fulfills its function  through  the  issuance  of  tax  exempt  or  taxable  revenue  bonds.    The  County's Board  of  Supervisors  appoints  the  Authority's  Board  of  Directors.    The  Authority's operations  are  completely  separate  from  the  County  and  the  County  is  not  financially accountable  for  the  Authority.    Therefore,  based  on  the  criterion  of  GASB  Statements Nos. 14, 39, and 61, the financial activities of the Authority have not been included in the accompanying financial statements.</p>

<h2>B. Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>The  basic  financial  statements  include  both  government-wide  statements  and  fund financial statements.  The government-wide statements focus on the County as a whole, while  the  fund  financial  statements  focus  on  major  funds.    Each  presentation  provides valuable  information  that  can  be  analyzed  and  compared  between  years  and  between governments to enhance the information's usefulness.</p>
<p>Government-wide statements -Provide information about the primary government (the County) and its component units.  The statements include a statement of net position and a  statement  of  activities.    These  statements  report  the  overall  government's  financial activities,  except  for  fiduciary  activities.    Governmental  activities  generally  are  financed through taxes and intergovernmental revenues.</p>
<p>A statement of activities presents a comparison between direct expenses and program revenues for each function of the County's governmental activities.  Direct expenses are those  that  are  specifically  associated  with  a  program  or  function  and,  therefore,  are clearly  identifiable  to  a  particular  function.    The  County  does  not  allocate  indirect expenses to programs or functions.  Program revenues include:</p>
<ul>
<li> charges to customers or applicants for goods, services, or privileges provided;</li>
<li> operating grants and contributions; and</li>
<li> capital grants and contributions, including special assessments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Revenues  that  are  not  classified  as  program  revenues,  including  internally  dedicated resources and all taxes the County levies or imposes, are reported as general revenues.</p>
<p>Generally, the effect of interfund activity has been eliminated from the government-wide financial  statements  to  minimize  the  double  counting  of  internal  activities.    However, charges  for  interfund  services  provided  and  used  are  not  eliminated  if  the  prices approximate their external exchange values.</p>
<p>Fund  financial  statements -Provide  information  about  the  County's  funds,  including fiduciary funds and blended component units.  Separate statements are presented for the governmental and fiduciary fund categories.  The emphasis of fund financial statements is  on  major  governmental  funds,  each  displayed  in  a  separate  column.    All  remaining governmental funds are aggregated and reported as nonmajor funds.  Fiduciary funds are aggregated and reported by fund type.</p>
<p>The County reports the following major governmental funds:</p>
<p>The General  Fund is  the  County's  primary  operating  fund.    It  accounts  for  all  financial resources  of  the  general  government,  except  those  required  to  be  accounted  for  in another fund.</p>
<p>The Jail  District  Fund accounts  for  County  jail  operations  and  is  funded  by  a  ¼  cent County sales tax.</p>
<h2>Yavapai County Notes to Financial Statements June 30, 2014</h2>
<p>The Regional  Road  Fund accounts  for  road  construction  and  maintenance  of  major regional roads and is funded by a portion of the ½ cent County sales tax and impact fees.</p>
<p>The HURF  Road  Fund accounts  for  road  maintenance  and  construction  of  nonmajor roads and is funded primarily by highway user revenue.</p>
<p>The Capital Projects Fund accounts for major capital projects and is funded by a portion of the ½ cent County sales tax.</p>
<p>The Capital  Projects  Debt  Service  Fund accounts  for  the  resources  accumulated  and payments made on the capital lease agreement for the construction of court and juvenile detention buildings.</p>
<p>The Poquito Valley Debt Service Fund accounts for the accumulation of resources for the payment of principal and interest on the revenue bonds issued for special assessment bonds.    Funding  for  the  special  assessment  debt  is  provided  by  assessments  made against the benefiting owners.</p>
<p>The County also reports the following fund types:</p>
<p>The investment trust funds account for pooled assets the County Treasurer holds and invests on behalf of other governmental entities.</p>
<p>The agency funds account for assets the County holds as an agent for the State, cities, towns, and other parties.</p>
<h2>C. Basis of Accounting</h2>
<p>The  government-wide  and  fiduciary  fund  financial  statements  are  presented  using  the economic  resources  measurement  focus  and  the  accrual  basis  of  accounting.    The agency funds are custodial in nature and do not have a measurement focus but utilize the accrual basis of accounting for reporting its assets and liabilities.  Revenues are recorded when earned, and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred, regardless of when the related cash flows take place.  Property taxes are recognized as revenue in the year for which they are levied.  Grants and donations are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements the provider imposed have been met.</p>
<p>Under  the  terms  of  grant  agreements,  the  County  funds  certain  programs  by  a combination  of  grants  and  general  revenues.  Therefore,  when  program  expenses  are incurred,  there  are  both  restricted  and  unrestricted  resources  available  to  finance  the program. The County applies grant resources, except for PILT, to such programs before using general revenues.</p>
<p>Governmental  funds  in  the  fund  financial  statements  are  reported  using  the  current financial  resources  measurement  focus  and  the  modified  accrual  basis  of  accounting. Under this method, revenues are recognized when they become both measurable and available.  The County considers all revenues reported in the governmental funds to be available if the revenues are collected within 60 days after year-end.  The County's major</p>
<h2>Yavapai County Notes to Financial Statements June 30, 2014</h2>
<p>revenue sources that are susceptible to accrual are property taxes, special assessments, intergovernmental,  charges  for  services,  and  investment  earnings.    Expenditures  are recorded when the related fund liability is incurred, except for principal and interest on general  long-term  debt,  claims  and  judgments,  compensated  absences,  and  landfill closure and postclosure care costs, which are recognized as expenditures to the extent they are due and payable. General capital asset acquisitions are reported as expenditures in governmental funds. Issuances of general long-term debt and acquisitions under capital lease agreements are reported as other financing sources.</p>
<h2>D. Cash and Investments</h2>
<p>Money market investments with a remaining maturity of 1 year or less at time of purchase are stated at amortized cost.  All other investments are stated at fair value.</p>
<h2>E. Inventories</h2>
<p>Inventories  in  the  government-wide  financial  statements  are  recorded  as  assets  when purchased and expensed when consumed.  These inventories are stated at cost using the first-in, first-out method.</p>
<p>The County accounts for its inventories in the governmental funds using the consumption method.  Inventories of the governmental funds consist of expendable supplies which are recorded  as  expenditures  when  consumed  rather  than  when  purchased.    Amounts  on hand at year end are shown on the balance sheet as an asset for informational purposes only and as nonspendable fund balance to indicate that they do not constitute 'available spendable  resources.'    These  inventories  are  stated  at  cost  using  the  first-in,  first-out method.</p>
<h2>F. Prepaid Items</h2>
<p>In the government-wide financial statements, prepaid purchases are recorded as assets when the goods or services are purchased and expensed over the period consumed.</p>
<p>Prepaid items are accounted for using the consumption method in the governmental fund financial statements.  Using this method, prepaid purchases are recorded as assets when the  goods  or  services  are  purchased  and  expensed  over  the  period  consumed. Amounts at  year-end  are  reported  on  the  balance  sheet  as  an  asset  for  informational purposes only and as nonspendable fund balance to indicate that they do not constitute 'available spendable resources.'</p>
<h2>G. Property Tax Calendar</h2>
<p>The  County  levies  real  and  personal  property  taxes  on  or  before  the  third  Monday  in August that become due and payable in two equal installments. The first installment is due on the first day of October and becomes delinquent after the first business day of November.  The second installment is due on the first day of March of the next year and becomes delinquent after the first business day of May.</p>
<h2>Yavapai County Notes to Financial Statements June 30, 2014</h2>
<p>A lien assessed against real and personal property attaches on the first day of January preceding assessment and levy.</p>
<h2>H. Capital Assets</h2>
<p>Capital assets are reported at actual cost, or estimated historical cost if historical records are  not  available.    Donated  assets  are  reported  at  estimated  fair  value  at  the  time received.</p>
<p>Capitalization thresholds (the dollar values above which asset acquisitions are added to the capital asset accounts), depreciation methods, and estimated useful lives of capital assets are as follows:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td></td><th>Capitalization Threshold</th><th>Depreciation Method</th><th>Estimated Useful Life</th></tr><tr><th>Land (including right of ways and easements)</th><td>$10,000</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><th>Buildings</th><td>10,000</td><td>Straight-line</td><td>20-40 years</td></tr><tr><th>Equipment</th><td>5,000</td><td>Straight-line</td><td>5-15 years</td></tr><tr><th>Infrastructure</th><td>10,000</td><td>Straight-line</td><td>10-75 years</td></tr><tr><th>Software</th><td>10,000</td><td>Straight-line</td><td>3-5 years</td></tr><tr><th>Construction in progress</th><td>10,000</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h2>I. Deferred Inflows of Resources</h2>
<p>The  balance  sheet  includes  a  separate  section  for  deferred  inflows  of  resources. Deferred  inflows  of  resources  represent  an  acquisition  of  fund  balance  that  applies  to future periods and will be recognized as a revenue in future periods.</p>
<h2>J. Fund Balance Classifications</h2>
<p>The  governmental  funds'  fund  balances  are  reported  separately  within  classifications based  on  a  hierarchy  of  the  constraints  placed  on  those  resources'  use.    The classifications are based on the relative strength of the constraints that control how the specific  amounts  can  be  spent.    The  classifications  are  nonspendable,  restricted,  and unrestricted, which includes committed, assigned, and unassigned fund balance classifications.</p>
<p>The  nonspendable  fund  balance  classification  includes  amounts  that  cannot  be  spent because  they  are  either  not  in  spendable  form,  such  as  inventories,  or  are  legally  or contractually required to be maintained intact.  Restricted fund balances are those that have externally imposed restrictions on their usage by creditors (such as through debt covenants), grantors, contributors, or laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The  unrestricted  fund  balance  category  is  composed  of  committed,  assigned,  and unassigned resources.    Committed  fund  balances  are  self-imposed  limitations  that  the County's Board of Supervisors approved, which is the highest level of decision-making authority within the County.  The Board can, by approval of an agenda item at a public meeting prior to the end of the fiscal year, commit fund balance.  Only the Board can</p>
<h2>Yavapai County Notes to Financial Statements June 30, 2014</h2>
<p>remove or change the constraints placed on committed fund balances, by approval of an agenda item to remove or revise the limitation.  Approval of an agenda item by the Board is the only highest level action that constitutes the most binding constraint.</p>
<p>Assigned fund balances are resources constrained by the County's intent to be used for specific  purposes,  but  are  neither  restricted  nor  committed.    The  Board  of  Supervisors has not delegated authority to make assignments of resources for a specific purpose.</p>
<p>The  unassigned  fund  balance  is  the  residual  classification  for  the  General  Fund  and includes all spendable amounts not reported in the other classifications.  Also, deficits in fund balances of the other governmental funds are reported as unassigned.</p>
<p>When an expenditure is incurred that can be paid from either restricted or unrestricted fund balances, the County will use restricted fund balance first.  For the disbursement of unrestricted  fund  balances,  the  County  will  use  committed  amounts  first,  followed  by assigned amounts, and lastly unassigned amounts.</p>
<h2>K. Investment Earnings</h2>
<p>Investment earnings is composed of interest, dividends, and net changes in the fair value of applicable investments.</p>
<h2>L. Compensated Absences</h2>
<p>Compensated absences payable consists of paid time off (PTO) leave employees earned based on services already rendered.</p>
<p>Employees may accumulate up to 764 hours of PTO, depending on years of service, but they forfeit any unused PTO hours in excess of the maximum amount each pay period. Upon terminating employment, the County pays all unused and unforfeited PTO benefits to  employees.  Accordingly, PTO benefits are accrued as a liability in the governmentwide financial statements.  A liability for these amounts is reported in the governmental funds'  financial  statements  only  if  they  have  matured,  for  example,  as  a  result  of employee resignations and retirements by fiscal year-end.</p>
<p>Employees  may  accumulate  up  to  520  hours  of  catastrophic  time  (CAT)  leave.    CAT leave may be used in the case of illness or injury suffered by an employee or employee's immediate family, but only after using at least forty hours of consecutive PTO leave.  CAT leave benefits are cumulative but employees forfeit them upon terminating employment. Because CAT leave benefits do not vest with employees, a liability for CAT leave benefits is not accrued in the financial statements.</p>
<h2>Note 2 Stewardship, Compliance, and Accountability</h2>
<p>Deficit  fund  balances-At  June  30,  2014,  the  Airport  Development  and  CYMPO (nonmajor  governmental)  Funds  reported  deficit  fund  balances  of  $37,389  and  $630, respectively.</p>

<h2>Special assessment debt</h2>
<p>Special assessment bonds are secured by pledges of revenues from special assessments levied against the benefiting property owners.  Bond proceeds were used to finance construction in these districts.  These bonds are generally callable with interest payable semiannually.  However, in accordance with the bond indenture for each special assessment  bond  issue,  and  in  the  opinion  of  the  County  Attorney,  the  County  is  not legally obligated in any way for the special assessment bonded indebtedness.  The total principal  and  interest  remaining  on  the  bonds  is  $3,057,640,  payable  through  January 2030.    Annual  principal  and  interest  payments  on  the  bonds  are  expected  to  require 100%  of  pledged  revenues.    Principal  and  interest  paid  for  the  current  year  were $319,717 and the special assessments were $445,823.</p>

<h2>Capital leases</h2>
<p>On  May  15,  2008,  the  County  entered  into  a  $50,000,000  capital  lease  agreement  to finance  the  construction  of  court,  administrative,  and  juvenile  detention  buildings.    The property for these facilities is owned by the County.  The lessor leased these sites from the County and leased the sites and the facilities being financed back to the County.  On June 15, 2009, the County entered into a revised capital lease agreement which allowed the  County  to  prepay  $25,000,000  in  principal  and  a  prepayment  penalty  of  $250,000. Lease  payments  will  equal  the  aggregate  amount  of  principal  and  interest  required  to extinguish the debt.  Upon the final lease payment, the title to the assets will transfer to the County.  The County's obligation to make lease payments will be subject to and is dependent upon annual appropriations being made by the County.</p>
<p>The assets acquired through the capital lease are as follows:</p>

<h2>Landfill closure and postclosure care costs</h2>
<p>State and federal laws and regulations require the County to place final covers on its 7 landfill  sites  when  they  stop  accepting  waste  and  to  perform  certain  maintenance  and monitoring  functions  at  the  sites  for  30  years  after  closure.  Although  closure  and postclosure care costs will not be paid until near or after the dates that the landfills stop accepting  waste,  the  County  reports  a  portion  of  these  closure  and  postclosure  care costs in each period that the County operates the landfills. These costs will be paid from the Landfill/Environment special revenue fund.</p>
<p>The amount recognized each year is based on landfill capacity used at the end of each fiscal  year.    All  7  landfills  stopped  accepting  waste  and  were  closed  prior  to  June  30, 2014.  As of June 30, 2014, the landfill closure and postclosure care liability of $977,380 represents the cumulative amount of costs remaining on these closed landfills, which is net  of  expenditures  incurred  to  date.    This  amount  is  based  on  what  it  would  cost  to perform all closure and postclosure care in fiscal year 2014 and has been adjusted for changes  in  estimates  during  the  fiscal  year.    The  actual  cost  may  be  higher  due  to inflation, changes in technology, or changes in regulations.</p>
<p>According to state and federal laws and regulations, the County must comply with the local  government financial test requirements that ensure that the County can meet the costs of landfill closure, postclosure, and corrective action when needed. The County is in compliance with these requirements.</p>
<h2>Insurance claims</h2>
<p>The County provides health benefits to its employees and their dependents through the Yavapai  Combined  Trust,  currently  composed  of  four  members.  The  Trust  provides benefits  up  to  $250,000  per  individual  per  plan  year  through  a  self-funding  agreement with  its  participants  and  purchases  commercial  insurance  to  cover  claims  in  excess  of this  limit.    The  Trust  does  not  provide  any  postemployment  benefits.    An  independent administrator  provides  the  trust  with  claim  and  recordkeeping  services.  The  County  is responsible  for  paying  the  premiums  and  requires  its  employees  to  contribute  for dependent coverage. The County is not liable for claims in excess of coverage limits and cannot be assessed retroactive premium adjustments. If it withdraws from the Trust, the County would be responsible for its proportional share of any claims run-out costs, which exceed Trust Fund reserves established for the incurred but not reported claims liability. If the Trust were to terminate, the County would be responsible for its proportional share of any Trust deficit.</p>

<h2>Compensated absences and claims and judgments</h2>
<p>Compensated absences are paid from various funds in the same proportion that those funds  pay  payroll  costs.  Claims  and  judgments  are  generally  paid  from  the  fund  that accounts for the activity that gave rise to the claim. During fiscal year 2014, the County paid  for  compensated  absences  as  follows:  57  percent  from  the  General  Fund,  17 percent from major funds, and 26 percent from other funds. The County paid for claims and judgments from the General Fund.</p>

<h2>Note 9 Risk Management</h2>
<p>The County is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, and destruction of assets; errors and omissions; injuries to employees; and natural disasters. For these risks of loss, the County joined and is covered by three public entity risk pools: the  Arizona  Counties  Property  and  Casualty  Pool  and  the  Arizona  Counties  Workers' Compensation Pool which are described below, and the Yavapai Combined Trust, which is described on page 46.</p>
<p>The Arizona Counties Property  and  Casualty  Pool  is  a  public  entity  risk  pool  currently composed of 11 member counties. The pool provides member counties catastrophic loss coverage for risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, and destruction of assets; errors  and  omissions;  and  natural  disasters;  and  provides  risk  management  services. Such  coverage  includes  all  defense  costs  as  well  as  the  amount  of  any  judgment  or settlement.  The  County  is  responsible  for  paying  a  premium  based  on  its  exposure  in relation  to  the  exposure  of  the  other  participants,  and  a  deductible  of  $25,000  per occurrence  for  property  claims  and  $50,000  per  occurrence  for  liability  claims.  The County is also responsible for any payments in excess of the maximum coverage of $300 million  per  occurrence  for  property  claims  and  $15  million  per  occurrence  for  liability claims.    However,  lower  limits  apply  to  certain  categories  of  losses.    A  county  must participate  in  the  pool  at  least  3  years  after  becoming  a  member;  however,  it  may withdraw after the initial 3-year period.</p>
<p>The Arizona Counties Workers' Compensation Pool is a public entity risk pool currently composed  of  11  member  counties.  The  pool  provides  member  counties  with  workers' compensation coverage, as law requires, and risk management services.  The County is responsible for paying a premium, based on an experience-rating formula that allocates pool expenditures and liabilities among the members.</p>
<p>The Arizona  Counties  Property  and  Casualty  Pool  and  the  Arizona  Counties  Workers' Compensation  Pool  receive  independent  audits  annually  and  an  audit  by  the  Arizona Department of Insurance every 5 years.  Both pools accrue liabilities for losses that have been incurred  but  not  reported.  These  liabilities  are  determined  annually  based  on  an independent actuarial valuation.  If a pool were to become insolvent, the County would be assessed an additional contribution.</p>

<h2>Note 10 -  Pensions and Other Postemployment Benefits</h2>
<p>Plan Descriptions - The County contributes to four plans, three of which are described below.    The  Elected  Officials  Retirement  Plan  is  not  described  due  to  its  relative insignificance to the County's financial statements.  The plans are component units of the State  of  Arizona,  state  statutes  establish  benefits,  and  the  plans  generally  provide retirement, long-term disability, and health insurance premium benefits, including death and survivor benefits.  The retirement benefits are generally paid at a percentage, based on years of service, of the retirees' average compensation.  Long-term disability benefits vary  by  circumstance,  but  generally  pay  a  percentage  of  the  employee's  monthly compensation.  The health insurance premium benefit is paid as a fixed dollar amount per  month  towards  the  retiree's  healthcare  insurance  premiums,  in  amounts  based  on whether the benefit is for the retiree or for the retiree and his or her dependents.</p>
<p>The Arizona  State  Retirement  System (ASRS)  administers  a  cost-sharing,  multipleemployer defined benefit pension plan; a cost-sharing, multiple-employer defined benefit health  insurance  premium  benefit  plan;  and  a  cost-sharing,  multiple-employer  defined benefit  long-term  disability  plan  that  covers  employees  of  the  State  of  Arizona  and employees of participating political subdivisions and school districts. The Arizona State Retirement System Board governs the ASRS according to the provisions of A.R.S. Title 38, Chapter 5, Article 2.</p>
<p>The Public Safety Personnel Retirement System (PSPRS) administers an agent multipleemployer defined  benefit  pension  plan  and  an  agent  multiple-employer  defined  benefit health  insurance  premium  benefit  plan  that  covers  public  safety  personnel  who  are regularly assigned hazardous duty as employees of the State of Arizona and participating political  subdivisions.  The  PSPRS,  acting  as  a  common  investment  and  administrative agent, is governed by a seven-member board known as the Board of Trustees and the participating  local  boards  according  to  the  provisions  of  A.R.S.  Title  38,  Chapter 5, Article 4.</p>
<p>The Corrections Officer Retirement Plan (CORP) administers an agent multiple-employer defined  benefit  pension  plan  and  an  agent  multiple-employer  defined  benefit  health insurance premium benefit plan that covers state, county, and local correction officers; dispatchers; and probation, surveillance, and juvenile detention officers.  The Dispatchers is  a  group  separately  covered  under  the  plan  and  is  not  described  due  to  its  relative insignificance  to  the  County's  financial  statements.    The  Administrative  Office  of  the Courts is a group separately covered under the plan in which the related plan information that follows is separately referred to as the CORP-AOC.  The CORP is governed by the PSPRS Board of Trustees and the participating local boards according to the provisions of A.R.S. Title 38, Chapter 5, Article 6.</p>
<p>Beginning in fiscal year 2014, PSPRS and CORP established separate funds for pension benefits  and  health  insurance  premium  benefits.  Previously,  the  plans  recorded  both pension and health insurance premium contributions in the same Pension Fund. During fiscal  year  2014,  the  plans  transferred  prior-year  health  insurance  premium  benefit contributions that exceeded benefit payments from each plan's Pension Fund to the new Health Insurance Fund.</p>

<p>All participating employers in the CORP-AOC are accounted for as one group within the Corrections Officer Retirement Plan, and as such, an actuarial valuation of CORP-AOC is prepared  only  for  the  group  as  a  whole.    Therefore,  actuarial  information  and  certain trend information for the County, as a participating government, are not available.</p>
<p>Actuarial  methods  and  assumptions -The  contribution  requirements  for  the  year ended June 30, 2014, were established by the June 30, 2012, actuarial valuations, and those actuarial valuations were based on the following actuarial methods and assumptions.</p>
<p>Actuarial valuations involve estimates of the value of reported amounts and assumptions about the probability of events in the future.  Amounts determined regarding the plans' funded status and the annual required contributions are subject to continual revision as actual  results  are  compared  to  past  expectations  and  new  estimates  are  made.    The required schedule of funding progress presented as required supplementary information provides multiyear trend information that shows whether the actuarial value of the plans' assets are increasing or decreasing over time relative to the actuarial accrued liability for benefits.</p>
<p>Projections of  benefits  are  based  on  (1)  the  plans  as  the  County  and  plans'  members understand them and include the types of benefits in force at the valuation date, and (2) the pattern of sharing benefit costs between the County and plans' members to that point. Actuarial calculations reflect a long-term perspective and employ methods and assumptions designed to reduce short-term  volatility  in  actuarial  accrued  liabilities  and the actuarial value of assets.  The significant actuarial methods and assumptions used are  the  same  for  both  plans  and  related  benefits  (unless  noted),  and  the  following actuarial  methods  and  assumptions  were  used  to  established  the  fiscal  year  2014 contribution requirements:</p>

<h2>Note 12 -  County Treasurer's Investment Pool</h2>
<p>Arizona  Revised  Statutes  require  community  colleges,  school  districts,  and  other  local governments to deposit certain public monies with the County Treasurer.  The Treasurer has  a  fiduciary  responsibility  to  administer  those  and  the  County's  monies  under  the Treasurer's  stewardship.    The  Treasurer  invests,  on  a  pool  basis,  all  idle  monies  not specifically invested for a fund or program.  In addition, the Treasurer determines the fair value of those pooled investments annually at June 30.</p>
<p>The  County  Treasurer's  investment  pool  is  not  registered  with  the  Securities  and Exchange Commission as an investment company, and there is no regulatory oversight of its operations.  The pool's structure does not provide for shares, and the County has not  provided  or  obtained  any  legally  binding  guarantees  to  support  the  value  of  the participants' investments.</p>
<p>The Treasurer allocates interest earnings to each of the pool's participants.  However, for the County's monies in the pool, the Board of Supervisors authorized $5,994 of interest earned in certain other funds to be transferred to the General Fund.</p>
<p>The deposits and investments the County holds are included in the County Treasurer's investment  pool,  except  for  $41,425  of  cash  on  hand  and  $4,121,509  of  deposits. Therefore,  the  deposit  and  investment  risks  of  the  Treasurer's  investment  pool  are substantially  the  same  as  the  County's  deposit  and  investment  risks.    See  Note  3  for disclosure of the County's deposit and investment risks.</p>
