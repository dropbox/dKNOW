<p>accept additional waste streams and treat waste using additional technologies. In order to do so, Conditions 1 and 5 of the Order would need to be revised.</p>
<h2>Alternatives to the Proposed Action</h2>
<p>The only alternative to the proposed action that the NRC staff considered was the no-action alternative. Under the noaction alternative, the Order would not be revised.</p>
<h2>Affected Environment</h2>
<p>The NRC staff has prepared an environmental impact statement (EIS) (NUREG-1476; August 1993), EAs, and SERs for its previous actions. The affected environment for the Envirocare site is described in detail in NUREG1476.</p>
<h2>Environmental Impacts of the Alternatives</h2>
<p>No-Action Alternative: For the noaction alternative, the environmental impacts would be the same as those evaluated in the EAs that support the May 21, 1999, Order (64 FR 26463, May 14, 1999), the January 30, 2003, modification of the Order (68 FR 3281, January 23, 2003), and the December 29, 2003, modification of the Order (68 FR 59645, October 16, 2003). The regulations regarding SNM possession in 10 CFR part 150 set mass limits whereby a licensee is exempted from the licensing requirements of 10 CFR part 70 and can be regulated by an Agreement State. The licensing requirements in 10 CFR part 70 apply to persons possessing greater than critical mass quantities (as defined in 10 CFR 150.11). The principal emphasis of 10 CFR part 70 is criticality safety and safeguarding SNM against diversion or sabotage. The NRC staff considers that criticality safety can be maintained by relying on concentration limits, under the specified conditions. These concentration limits are considered an alternative definition of quantities not sufficient to form a critical mass to the weight limits in 10 CFR 150.11, thereby assuring the same level of protection. The 1999 and the two 2003 EAs concluded that issuance of the Order would have no significant radiological or non-radiological environmental impacts.</p>
<p>Proposed Action: For the proposed action, the environmental impacts are not expected to be significant. Effluent releases and potential doses to the public are regulated by the State of Utah and are not anticipated to change as a result of this revision. The NRC staff previously determined in the 1999 EA that there would be no significant</p>
<p>VerDate jul&lt;14&gt;2003</p>
<p>radiological or non-radiological impacts resulting from the proposed limits of uranium and plutonium. In addition, these revisions to the Order are not expected to significantly change environmental impacts from current operations at Envirocare.</p>
<p>For Envirocare, the changes to the limits will allow the site to accept new waste streams, which may increase the number of waste shipments to the site. It is estimated that this may result in approximately 100 additional shipments per year to the site, which equates to about two shipments per week. It is not expected that the small increase in shipments would have a significant environmental impact to the local area.</p>
<p>In addition, it is not expected that Envirocares's use of the new waste processing technologies would have significant environmental impacts. These technologies would be used in treating and stabilizing waste containing SNM, and any effluents from these processes would be collected and managed to prevent release. As stated previously, potential radiological doses are not anticipated to change as a result of the use of these new technologies.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Based on its review, the NRC staff finds that the environmental impacts from the proposed action and the noaction alternative are similar. Since the proposed action will not significantly impact the quality of the human environment, the NRC staff concludes that the proposed action is the preferred alternative.</p>
<h2>Agencies and Persons Consulted</h2>
<p>Officials from the State of Utah, Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Radiation Control were contacted about this EA for the proposed action and had no comments. Because the proposed action is not expected to have any impact on threatened or endangered species or historic resources, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the State of Utah Historic Preservation Officer were not contacted.</p>
<h2>III. Finding of No Significant Impact</h2>
<p>On the basis of the EA, The NRC has concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts from the proposed amendment and has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement.</p>
<h2>IV. Further Information</h2>
<p>Documents related to this action, including the application for amendment and supporting documentation, will be available</p>

<h2>Proposed Collection; Comment Request</h2>
<p>SUMMARY: In accordance with the requirement of Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 which provides opportunity for public comment on new or revised data collections, the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) will publish periodic summaries of proposed data collections.</p>
<p>Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the proposed information collection is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the RRB's estimate of the burden of the collection of the information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden related to the collection of information on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology.</p>
<p>Title and Purpose of information collection: Annual Earnings</p>

<p>Questionnaire for Annuitants in Last Pre-Retirement Non-Railroad Employment; OMB 3220-0179.</p>
<p>Under section 2(e)(3) of the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA), an annuity is not payable for any month in which a beneficiary works for a railroad. In addition, an annuity is reduced for any month in which the beneficiary works for an employer other than a railroad employer and earns more than a prescribed amount. Under the 1988 amendments to the RRA, the Tier II portion of the regular annuity and any supplemental annuity must be reduced by one dollar for each two dollars of Last Pre-Retirement Non-Railroad Employment (LPE) earnings for each month of such service. However, the reduction cannot exceed fifty percent of the Tier II and supplemental annuity amount for the month to which such deductions apply. LPE generally refers to an annuitant's last employment with a non-railroad person, company, or institution prior to retirement which was performed whether at the same time of, or after an annuitant stopped railroad employment. The collection obtains earnings information needed by the RRB to determine if possible reductions in annuities because of Last Pre-Retirement Non-Railroad Employment Earnings (LPE) are in order.</p>
<p>The RRB utilizes Form G-19L to obtain LPE earnings information from annuitants. Companion Form G-19L.1, which serves as an instruction sheet and contains the Paperwork Reduction/ Privacy Act Notice for the collection accompanies each Form G-19L sent to an annuitant. One response is requested of each respondent. Completion is required to retain a benefit. The RRB proposes a minor non-burden impacting editorial change to Form G-19L for clarification purposes.</p>
<p>The estimated annual respondent burden is as follows:</p>
<p>Estimated number of responses: 300. Estimated completion time per response: 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Estimated annual burden hours: 75. Additonal Information or Comments: To request more information or to obtain a copy of the information collection justification, forms, and/or supporting material, please call the RRB Clearance Officer at (312) 751-3363 or send an e-mail request to Charles.Mierzwa@RRB.GOV. Comments regarding the information collection should be addressed to Ronald J. Hodapp, Railroad Retirement Board, 844 North Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611-2092 or send an e-mail to Ronald.Hodapp@RRB.GOV. Written</p>
