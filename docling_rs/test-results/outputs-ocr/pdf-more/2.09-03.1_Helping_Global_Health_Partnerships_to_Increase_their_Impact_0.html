<h2>Framework:  We think about performance in terms of both processes and enablers -(2) Enablers</h2>
<p>|</p>
<h2>Challenges (1): Many Global Health Partnerships find some performance processes challenging given their complex environment and structure</h2>
<p>|</p>
<h2>Challenges (2): Many GHPs also struggle with the right enablers</h2>
<p>|</p>
<h2>Diagnostic phase findings (1): The Stop TB Partnership displays a number of strengths across performance processes</h2>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: '▪ ';">Setting objectives - GDF objectives are clearly defined and distinguish "the change the GDF hopes to bring about in the world' (e.g., Millennium Development Goals - 70% TB cases diagnosed, 85% cure rate) from the internal goals it sets itself that will enable this change</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '▪ ';">Establishing clear metrics and setting targets - MDR-TB Working Group defines concrete metrics (e.g., number of patients with access to MDR-TB treatment; research projects launched for evaluation of diagnostic algorithms) and sets specific targets for these metrics (e.g. for 2009, 200000 patients, 4 projects)</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '▪ ';">Tracking and disseminating metrics - Despite limited resources for performance management, GDF manages to track and report on a wide variety of metrics to meet the different demands of donors</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '▪ ';">Reviewing performance - In response to donor demands, the Advocacy Team conducts an in-depth review of performance against objectives stated in funding proposal so as to take stock of results achieved and lessons learned</li>
</ul>
<p>|</p>
<h2>Diagnostic phase findings (2): The Stop TB Partnership also displays a number of strengths across the enablers of performance</h2>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: '▪ ';">Committed leadership</li>
<li>-GDF leaders driving performance improvement initiatives</li>
<li>-Coordinating Board members supporting focus on performance</li>
<li>-Secretariat leaders setting ambitious performance targets for teams</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '▪ ';">Culture - GDF has created a culture of performance with a focus on continuous improvement and quality management. The team is actively eliciting feedback on performance, e.g., through the Business Advisory Committee</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '▪ ';">Communication - The Advocacy Team engages in ongoing communication across the Secretariat as well as with key partners such as the Stop TB department at WHO and the TB-HIV Working Group. Thereby, performance objectives are well known among relevant stakeholders</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '▪ ';">Capacity - The Communications, Marketing and Branding Team makes efficient use of pro bono resources volunteered by partners. These resources are used to deliver some of the team's activities (e.g., production and distribution of public service announcements) as well as to assess performance against specific metrics (e.g., data received from partner on number of viewers)</li>
</ul>
<p>|</p>
<h2>Diagnostic phase findings (3): Brief overview of performance issues we have jointly agreed to address in Design and Deliver phases (more detail in following sections)</h2>
<table><tbody><tr><td></td><th>Central Global Health Partnership performance issue</th><th>Specific question addressed with Partnership body</th></tr><tr><td>GDF</td><td>▪ Agreeing the right metrics for objectives that are difficult to measure</td><td>▪ GDF tracks 250 metrics but - Not all are related to GDF - Some overlap - Metrics are not organized systematically/hierarchically</td></tr><tr><td>Advocacy</td><td>▪ Setting advocacy objectives that stay current and relevant in changing external circumstances</td><td>▪ Setting advocacy objectives within Stop TB Partnership that stay current and relevant in changing external circumstances</td></tr><tr><td>Communication, Marketing and Branding</td><td>▪ Getting from a vision to the specific objectives for the partnership and its bodies rather than directly to activities ▪ Agreeing the right metrics for objectives that are difficult to measure, e.g., awareness</td><td>▪ Determining detailed objectives for each audience group that the Communications, marketing and branding team seeks to address ▪ Define metrics for each detailed objective</td></tr><tr><td>Challenge Facility for Civil Society</td><td>▪ Getting from a vision to the specific objectives for the partnership and its bodies rather than directly to activities</td><td>▪ Refine the mission based on experience and lessons learned in the first two years of the CFCS program ▪ Articulate specific objectives around the newly refined mission statement</td></tr><tr><td>MDR-TB Working Group</td><td>▪ Ensuring partners within a loose working group arrangement are engaged and motivated to contribute</td><td>McKinsey &amp; Company 13 | ▪ Developing a simple survey-based tool to assess the level of working group engagement</td></tr></tbody></table>
