<li>† Background and Aims Fire scars have been widely used as proxies for the reconstruction of fire history; however, little is known about the impact of fire injury on wood anatomy. This study investigates changes in tracheid and ray traits in fire scars of Douglas fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii ), western larch ( Larix occidentalis ) and ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa ), and discusses their ecophysiological implications for tree recovery from fire.</li>
<li>† Methods Transverse and tangential microsections were prepared for light microscopy and image analysis. Measurements of tracheids and rays were made in the three spatial dimensions: axially (at different section heights), radially (in different rings) and tangentially (with increasing distance from the wound margin).</li>
<li>† KeyResults Changes were strongest in the first year after fire injury, with a decrease in tracheid size (by 25-30 %) andanincreaseintracheiddensity(by21-53 %)forthethreespecies.Inaddition,anincreaseinraysize(by5-27 %) andanincreaseinraydensity(by19-36 %)werefoundin P. menziesii and L.occidentalis . Changeswerecomparable along the fire-injured stem and were often most marked close to the fire scar.</li>
<li>† Conclusions The differentiation after fire injury of narrower and more numerous tracheids expresses a trade-off between hydraulic safety and hydraulic efficiency, while that of larger and more numerous rays serves compartmentalization and wound closure, mechanical strength and defence responses. Pinus ponderosa does not generally produce more ray tissue after fire injury and thus appears to be more adapted to fire.</li>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Fire scars form on trees when surface fires of low to moderate intensity heat the cambium to lethal temperatures around a portion of the bole (Gutsell and Johnson, 1996). Similarly to other types of mechanical injury to the cambium, tree response to fire injury includes (1) compartmentalization to resist the spread of decay and (2) production of wound xylem (or woundwood) to close the wound and restore continuity of the cambium (Smith and Sutherland, 1999, 2001). Wound closure occurs from the growth of new, healthy vascular tissues that converge inward from both sides of the wound to shield the exposed xylem (Larson, 1994; Fink, 1999).</p>
<p>Fire scars provide macroscopic - at the samplelevel - evidence of past forest fires that has been used to determine the occurrence, extent and frequency of events (Heyerdahl et al. , 2001; Swetnam et al. , 2009; Farris et al. , 2010; Falk et al. , 2011). Nevertheless, limitations of fire scars (Van Horne and Fule ´, 2006) have motivated the exploration of alternative proxies for the reconstruction of fire history. In this context, both scarred and unscarred trees have been studied for microscopic - at the tissue level - evidence of past forest fires, including anomalies in wood anatomy (Bigio et al. , 2010; Bravo, 2010; Kames et al. , 2011) and wood chemistry (Bukata et al. , 2008; Beghin et al. , 2011; Pearson et al. , 2011). At thesametime,agrowingbodyofresearchonmechanicallyinjured trees has presented results on the wood anatomical response of conifers and broad-leaved trees to flooding (Ballesteros et al. , 2010 a , b ; Arbellay et al. , 2012 b ) and mass-movement processes (Bollschweiler et al. , 2008; Stoffel and Hitz, 2008; Schneuwly et al. , 2009 a , b ; Arbellay et al. , 2010, 2012 a , 2013). However, the impact of fire injury on wood anatomy has been assessed more rarely and conifers have yet to be investigated, as existing studies on the topic have been conducted exclusively with broadleaved trees (Bigio et al. , 2010; Bravo, 2010).</p>
<p>This study elucidates the wood anatomical response of conifers to fire injury. Tracheids and rays were analysed for changes in size and density in fire scars of three widely distributed North American conifers: Douglas fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii ), western larch ( Larix occidentalis ) and ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa ). Changes were measured axially (at different section heights), radially (in different rings) and tangentially (with increasing distance from the wound margin). This work determines the spatio-temporal extent of these changes, discusses their ecophysiological implications for tree recovery</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>from fire, and evaluates their potential as new proxy evidence for tree exposure to fire.</p>

<h2>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>
<p>WX</p>
<p>Field campaign and sample preparation</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>In mid-August 2003, the lightning-ignited Black Mountain fire burned 2800 ha of the Lolo National Forest near Missoula, west central Montana, USA. In late August through September 2011, 32 Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco, 11 Larix occidentalis Nutt. and 18 Pinus ponderosa P.Lawson &amp; C.Lawson trees with charred bark were sampled in the Dry Gulch area (46 8 52 ′ N/114 8 12 ′ W, 1787 m a.s.l.; E. K. Sutherland, USDA Forest Service, Missoula, USA, pers. comm.). Cross-sections were taken at 25 cm intervals up to the complete height of the bark char. For this study, two scarred trees of each species were chosen for wood anatomical analysis (Table 1), which was performed on cross-sections taken at four different section heights (25, 50, 75 and 100 cm above the ground surface) along the fire-injured stem (Fig. 1A). In total, 24 cross-sections were sectioned with a chisel to obtain a wood block where tracheids and rays could be compared between normal xylem and wound xylem within 4 cm from the wound margin (Fig. 1B). Each wood block was further split into two 2 cm wide pieces for preparation of 15 m m thick microsections with a sliding microtome. The more friable P. ponderosa microsections were cut 30 m m thick. In a first step, transverse microsections (Fig. 1C) were prepared to analyse earlywood tracheids in the last ring formed pre-fire (ring 0) and in the first, second, fourth and eighth rings formed post-fire (rings 1, 2, 4 and 8). Despite the fact that fire injury affects cells formed pre-fire via necrosis of the directly injured cells and increased metabolic activity of the adjoining uninjured cells (Fink, 1999), fire injury does not affect the size and density of these cells. Nevertheless, preliminarycomparativeanalyseswerecarriedoutamongringsofnormal</p>

In a second step, tangential microsections (Fig. 1D) were prepared to analyse rays, requiring two radial cuts (one through normal xylem and one through wound xylem). The latter cut was performed about 2 mm inside the wound xylem, i.e. within ring 1 or 2. All microsections (144 in total) were stained with a 1 % safranin and astrablue solution, rinsed with water, alcohols and xylol, and mounted permanently on microscope slides using Canada balsam.</p>

Ray size was based on uniseriate rays, whereas ray density was derived from both uniseriate and fusiform rays. Measurements were made at the four section heights and in the five rings mentioned previously, and at 0 . 5 cm intervals along the 4 cm wide tangential window. A total of 48 000 earlywood tracheids were recorded: 4 section heights × 5 rings × 8 tangential measurements × 50 tracheids at each location ¼ 8000ineach tree. The unit area considered at each location on the transverse microsections was about 0 . 01 mm 2 .

As a consequence, and for ease of comparison, data from the four section heights were pooled together in the results.</p>
<h2>RESULTS</h2>
<p>Changes in tracheid traits</p>
<p>The ATLAvalues pre-fire were 695 m m 2 in PSM1, 1013 m m 2 in LAO1and764 m m 2 in PIP1 (Fig. 2). In all trees and in equivalent magnitude in the three species, ATLA decreased significantly in wound xylem, by 25-30 % in ring 1 and by 13-25 % in ring 2 (Table 2). This decrease was most marked close to the fire scar. In ring 1, ATLA values at 0 . 5 cm from the scar were 314 m m 2 in PSM1, 523 m m 2 in LAO1 and 256 m m 2 in PIP1 (Fig. 2). PSM1, LAO1 and LAO2 showed a significant increase in ATLA by ring 8 (by 10-13 %), apparent within the entire tangential window and originating from the base of the tree. In comparison, PSM2 and PIP1 still showed a significant decrease in ATLA by ring 8 (by 5-8 %), although signs of recovery started to appear inthelowersectionheights.PIP2stillproducednarrowertracheids in ring 8 (by 32 %) with no evident signs of recovery.</p>
<p>The TD values pre-fire were 1426 mm -2 in PSM1, 977 mm -2 in LAO1 and 1266 mm -2 in PIP1 (Fig. 3). TD increased significantly in wound xylem, in all trees and in equivalent magnitude in the three species (Table 2). This increase was strongest in ring 1 (21-53 %) and was most marked close to the fire scar. In ring 1, TD values at 0 . 5 cm from the scar were 2406 mm -2 in PSM1, 1906 mm -2 in LAO1 and 2219 mm -2 in PIP1 (Fig. 3). TD increase post-fire was no longer significant by ring 4 in PSM1 and by ring 8 in PSM2, LAO1, LAO2 and PIP1. Pre-fire values were regained within the entire tangential window in these rings. PIP2 was again slower in terms of recovery, still producing more numerous tracheids in ring 8 (by 21 %).</p>

<p>ARH and ARW increased significantly in wound xylem in P. menziesii (by 14-27 %) and L. occidentalis (by 5-21 %) (Table 3). These increases showed local fluctuations as opposed to localized peaks of intensity (Fig. 4). In contrast, P. ponderosa exhibited no increases in wound xylem: ARH and ARW values weresignificantly lower in PIP1 (by 5-8 %) and not significantly different in PIP2 (Table 3).</p>
<p>The RD values pre-fire were 35 mm -2 in PSM1, 31 mm -2 in LAO1 and 27 mm -2 in PIP1. RD increased significantly in wound xylem in P. menziesii (by 19-25 %) and L. occidentalis (by 3336 %) (Table 3). This increase was most marked close to the fire scar. At 0 . 5 cm from the scar, RD increased by 52 % in PSM1 and by 56 % in LAO1 (Fig. 4). In P. ponderosa , however, RD values were not significantly different in wound xylem (Table 3), although more numerous rays were produced close to the scar (Fig. 4).</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p>Changes in tracheid traits</p>
<p>Pseudotsuga menziesii , L. occidentalis and P. ponderosa all produced narrower and more numerous tracheids after fire injury (Fig. 5C), most conspicuously in the first post-fire ring (Fig. 5A, B). Similar responses were observed in some other species exposed to fire. Nicholls (1972) described a 'fire ring' made of smaller vessels in Eucalyptus marginata . Moreover, narrower and more numerous vessels were detected within the fire ring in Castanea sativa (Bigio et al. , 2010) and in the first post-fire ring in Fraxinus nigra (Kames et al. , 2011).</p>
<p>The decrease in conduit size caused by fire injury corresponds to that associated with other types of mechanical injury to the cambium induced by other natural hazards (flooding and mass-movement processes) or human actions (partial girdling, pinning and drilling). Wound xylem has shown narrower tracheids in Pinus halepensis , Larix decidua and Pinus pinaster (Fahn and Zamski, 1970; Stoffel and Hitz, 2008; Ballesteros et al. , 2010 a ) and narrower vessels in various broad-leaved tree species (Bauch et al. , 1980; Aloni and Zimmermann, 1984; Rademacher et al. , 1984; Lowerts et al. , 1986; Lev-Yadun and Aloni, 1993; Arbellay et al. , 2010, 2012 a , b , 2013; Ballesteros et al. , 2010 b ).

<p>size is related negatively to auxin concentration and to the rate of conduit differentiation has been confirmed repeatedly (Leitch, 2001; Lovisolo et al. , 2002; Anfodillo et al. , 2012). The formation of abnormally narrow tracheids in P. menziesii , L. occidentalis and P. ponderosa after fire injury would thus be accounted for by a local obstruction of the basipetal flow of auxin by the fire scar, consequently raising the auxin concentration in the injured area and causing rapid tracheid differentiation (Aloni and Zimmermann, 1983, 1984). Furthermore, ethylene is synthesized following wounding (Imaseki, 1985) and is also likely to influence tracheid formation by interfering with the flow of auxin (Abeles et al. , 1992; Aloni et al. , 2000). Ethylene stimulated the development of numerous abnormally narrow vessels in Ulmus americana (Yamamoto et al. , 1987) and increased the density of tracheids in Pinus halepensis (Yamamoto and Kozlowski, 1987).</p>
<p>Knowledge about conduit density after cambial injury is scarce. The barrier zone in broad-leaved trees is known to contain fewer vessels than normal xylem (Mulhern et al. , 1979; Bauch et al. , 1980; Rademacher et al. , 1984; Lowerts et al. , 1986; Stobbe et al. , 2002). Wound xylem (or woundwood), asthebroaderbandofwoodassociatedwithinjury,hasbeenlittle investigated. Nevertheless, and in line with the increase in conduit density caused by fire injury, wound xylem contained more vessels than normal xylem in Acer rubrum after partial girdling (Aloni and Zimmermann, 1984) and in Fraxinus excelsior after flood-induced wounding (Arbellay et al. , 2012 b ).</p>
<p>Changes in ray traits</p>
<p>Pseudotsuga menziesii and L. occidentalis produced larger and more numerous rays after fire injury (Fig. 5D), which concurs</p>
<p>with results on mechanically injured trees where fire was not the cause of injury (Carmi et al. , 1972; Bauch et al. , 1980; Kuroda and Shimaji, 1984; Rademacher et al. , 1984; Lowerts et al. ,</p>

<p>1986; Lev-Yadun and Aloni, 1992, 1993; Lev-Yadun, 1994; Arbellay et al. , 2012 b ). In contrast, P. ponderosa did not generally produce more ray tissue (radial parenchyma) after fire injury. Changesinraysizeanddensitycanvaryamongspeciesofdifferent genera(Bravo,2010)aswellasamongspeciesofthesamegenus.In contrast to P. ponderosa , pinning increased ray size in Pinus taeda (Kuroda and Shimaji, 1984), while partial girdling increased both ray size and density in Pinus halepensis (Lev-Yadun and Aloni, 1992).</p>
<p>Pinus sp. are also different from other conifers in their resin duct formation following wounding (Fahn and Zamski, 1970; Lewinsohn et al. , 1991; Stoffel, 2008). Resin ducts are also parenchyma,astheyarelinedwithalayerofsecretory,parenchymaticepithelial cells (Wu and Hu, 1997). It is possible that the amount of parenchyma in wound xylem is determined byspecies-specific sensitivity to wound-induced ethylene, which would explain the different amount of ray tissue between P. menziesii , L. occidentalis and P. ponderosa . Ethylene promotes ray enlargement as well as resin duct formation (Barker, 1979; Yamamoto and Kozlowski, 1987; Yamamoto et al. , 1987; Fahn, 1988; Lev-Yadun and Aloni, 1992; HudginsandFranceschi, 2004). A recent studyon resin duct formation in fire scars of P. menziesii and L. occidentalis yielded contrasting results between the two species (E. Arbellay, University of British Columbia, Canada, unpubl. res.), supporting the above hypothesis.</p>

<p>after fire injury and in the immediate vicinity of the fire scar. Arbellay et al. (2012 b ) made similar observations in Fraxinus excelsior after flood-induced wounding. In P. menziesii and L. occidentalis , changes in ray density were also most pronounced in the immediate vicinity of the fire scar, whereas changes in ray size were distributed more evenly with increasing distance from the wound margin. Changes in tracheid and ray traits were comparable along the fire-injured stem, although signs of recovery appeared over time in the form of lesser reduced or larger tracheids toward the base of the tree, seemingly more highly plastic.</p>
<p>In each tree, several factors act in concert to determine the severity of cambial injury (Table 1) as well as the magnitude of subsequent changes in wood anatomy (Tables 2 and 3). These factors include those that influence the rate of wound closure, i.e. wound size, tree species, tree vigour (or growth rate), tree age and tree diameter (Martin and Sydnor, 1987; Neely, 1988; Schneuwly-Bollschweiler and Schneuwly, 2012). Fire-scar formation initially depends on tree vigour, tree age and tree diameter (Guyette and Stambaugh, 2004), bark thickness (Hengst and Dawson, 1994; Pinard et al. , 1997) and fuel conditions at the base of the tree (Kolb et al. , 2007; Stephens et al. , 2010).</p>
<p>Moreover, the trees of this study had portions of their crown scorched (E. K. Sutherland, USDA Forest Service, Missoula, USA,pers.comm.).Bothboleandcrowndamageaffectpost-fire growth (Wyant et al. , 1986; Ryan and Reinhardt, 1988; Peterson et al. , 1991) and thereby tree recovery from fire.</p>
<p>Ecophysiological implications of changes in tracheid and ray traits</p>
<p>Fire and associated heating cause tree mortality directly by reducing xylem conductivity (Ducrey et al. , 1996; Balfour and Midgley, 2006) via cavitation and conduit wall deformation (Michaletz et al. , 2012). North-temperate conifers increase their resistance to cavitation by narrowing tracheid diameter rather than by thickening tracheid walls (Pittermann et al. , 2006 b ). This narrowing of conduits for cavitation resistance and the need for mechanical support constrain the hydraulic efficiency of the xylem (Hacke et al. , 2001; Pittermann et al. , 2006 a , b ; Sperry et al. , 2006). Pseudotsuga menziesii , L. occidentalis and P. ponderosa would have evolved narrower tracheids after fire injury as a safety measure against cavitation, to the benefit of mechanical support, but at the expense of hydraulic efficiency. The three species of this study also built more numerous tracheids after fire injury. A substantial number of reduced-size tracheids were therefore created, making the xylem porous enough to prevent embolism and provide conductance (Sperry et al. , 2008). This trade-off between hydraulic safety and hydraulic efficiency has been confirmed for P. menziesii , L. occidentalis and P. ponderosa (Pin ˜ol and Sala, 2000; Domec and Gartner, 2001, 2003).</p>
<p>Pseudotsuga menziesii and L. occidentalis increased the amount of parenchyma in wound xylem by producing larger and more numerous rays. This shift in tissue composition facilitates compartmentalization and wound closure (Shigo, 1984; Smith and Sutherland, 1999, 2001), reduces notch stresses at the wound margin and reinforces mechanical strength (Mattheck, 1998; Burgert et al. , 1999). An increased amount of parenchyma is also important for the refilling of embolized conduits (Ho ¨ltta ¨ et al. , 2006; Nardini et al. , 2011) and for the inductionofdefenceresponses,i.e.theformationoftraumaticresin ducts and the activation of polyphenolic parenchymacells (Nagy et al. , 2000; Hudgins and Franceschi, 2004). Interestingly, P. ponderosa did not generally produce more ray tissue after fire injury despite the higher vulnerability of Pinus sp. to water stress-induced embolism compared with other conifers (Pin ˜ol and Sala, 2000; Martı ´nez-Vilalta et al. , 2004). This suggests P. ponderosa to be more adapted to fire.</p>
<p>Changes in wood anatomy in fire-scarred P. menziesii , L. occidentalis and P. ponderosa reflect the phenotypic plasticity and structural adaptations of the xylem to respond to multiple, competing functional necessities (Baas et al. , 2004; Chave et al. , 2009). They provide new ecophysiological insights into the spatio-temporal responsiveness of conifers to fire injury. Moreover, these features could constitute alternative proxies for the reconstruction of fire history and expand our understanding of fire as an evolutionary force.</p>
