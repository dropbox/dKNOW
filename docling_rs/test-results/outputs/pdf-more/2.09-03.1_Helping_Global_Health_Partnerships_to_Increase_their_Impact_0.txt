## Framework:  We think about performance in terms of both processes and enablers -(2) Enablers

|

## Challenges (1): Many Global Health Partnerships find some performance processes challenging given their complex environment and structure

|

## Challenges (2): Many GHPs also struggle with the right enablers

|

## Diagnostic phase findings (1): The Stop TB Partnership displays a number of strengths across performance processes

## Examples

- Setting objectives - GDF objectives are clearly defined and distinguish "the change the GDF hopes to bring about in the world' (e.g., Millennium Development Goals - 70% TB cases diagnosed, 85% cure rate) from the internal goals it sets itself that will enable this change
- Establishing clear metrics and setting targets - MDR-TB Working Group defines concrete metrics (e.g., number of patients with access to MDR-TB treatment; research projects launched for evaluation of diagnostic algorithms) and sets specific targets for these metrics (e.g. for 2009, 200000 patients, 4 projects)
- Tracking and disseminating metrics - Despite limited resources for performance management, GDF manages to track and report on a wide variety of metrics to meet the different demands of donors
- Reviewing performance - In response to donor demands, the Advocacy Team conducts an in-depth review of performance against objectives stated in funding proposal so as to take stock of results achieved and lessons learned

|

## Diagnostic phase findings (2): The Stop TB Partnership also displays a number of strengths across the enablers of performance

## Examples

- Committed leadership
- -GDF leaders driving performance improvement initiatives
- -Coordinating Board members supporting focus on performance
- -Secretariat leaders setting ambitious performance targets for teams
- Culture - GDF has created a culture of performance with a focus on continuous improvement and quality management. The team is actively eliciting feedback on performance, e.g., through the Business Advisory Committee
- Communication - The Advocacy Team engages in ongoing communication across the Secretariat as well as with key partners such as the Stop TB department at WHO and the TB-HIV Working Group. Thereby, performance objectives are well known among relevant stakeholders
- Capacity - The Communications, Marketing and Branding Team makes efficient use of pro bono resources volunteered by partners. These resources are used to deliver some of the team's activities (e.g., production and distribution of public service announcements) as well as to assess performance against specific metrics (e.g., data received from partner on number of viewers)

|

## Diagnostic phase findings (3): Brief overview of performance issues we have jointly agreed to address in Design and Deliver phases (more detail in following sections)

| Communication, Marketing and Branding | ▪ Getting from a vision to the specific objectives for the partnership and its bodies rather than directly to activities ▪ Agreeing the right metrics for objectives that are difficult to measure, e.g., awareness | ▪ Determining detailed objectives for each audience group that the Communications, marketing and branding team seeks to address ▪ Define metrics for each detailed objective        |

## CFCS issues and opportunities

|

## The team conducted 4 workshops to revise the CFCS mission, objectives, selection and evaluation criteria

- Refine current mission based on the experience accumulated since program inception, reviews and lessons from field visits 1
- Define objectives based on the newly revised mission 2
- Determine the proper set of application selection criteria that best help achieve CFCS objectives 3
- Define grant evaluation criteria and template to allow for easy and efficient assessment of individual grant performance 4

|

|

## The CFCS team can use 2 simple indicators to monitor performance against the objectives

| Objectives                                          | Metrics                                                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Assist community- based civil society organizations | Percentage of funded projects that have impact, defined as achieving ≥ X score on evaluation criteria |
| Efficiently manage CFCS resources                   | Percentage of funds dispersed to projects that receive ≥ Y score on selection criteria                |

The selection and evaluation criteria help to define performance standards

## The selection template will allow the selection committee to assess if proposals aim to deliver against CFCS objectives

## MDR-TB Working Group issues and opportunities

## GHP performance issue

## Enablers

- Culture - Ensuring partners within a loose working group arrangement are engaged and motivated to contribute
- Capacity - Allocating significant resources to performance management given limited resources for internal processes

## Processes

- Agreeing the right metrics for objectives that are difficult to measure 2
- Committing to targets is difficult because of voluntary nature of partnerships 3

## MDR-TB Working Group improvement opportunities

## Enablers

- Developing a simple survey-based tool to assess the level of working group engagement
- The procedural operations of the WG (e.g., following-up on specific activities) are restricted by limited secretariat/ managerial resources

## Processes

- Metrics set by the WG could be more explicitly tied to objectives of the WG and its members 2
- Accountabilities and timelines for specific actions/outcomes are not always clear 3
