<h2>NARA Notice 2020-133: Health Screening Procedures to Respond to COVID-19</h2>
<p>To: All Employees.</p>
<p>Attention supervisors: If you have employees who do not have access to a computer, please ensure that those employees receive a copy of this notice. This includes employees on LWOP or paid leave.</p>
<p>This message communicates changes in NARA policy that are necessary to protect the health and safety of staff and contractors in the workplace and to prepare for the future reopening of NARA facilities.</p>
<p>Effective immediately, all staff and contractors must check their own temperature and answer three questions about their health status before reporting for on-site work at a NARA facility. Staff and contractors must ask themselves the following questions before leaving for work on every day that you are scheduled to work in a NARA facility:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '1. ';">Are you currently experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19?</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '2. ';">Have you been diagnosed with COVID-19 (with or without symptoms), or has a health care provider advised you to stay at home or otherwise self-isolate?</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '3. ';">Have you been in close physical contact (within 6 feet for longer than 15 minutes) with a person who has been diagnosed with COVID-19?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you answer "Yes" to any of these questions, do not come to work. Contact your supervisor to tell her or him that you answered "yes" to one or more of the questions. Then seek medical attention. Additional information is included in the attached COVID-19 Fact Sheet #9, Health Screening for NARA Employees and Contractors.</p>
<p>When you contact your supervisor, she or he will ask you a few questions to determine if the facility must be cleaned and whether your co-workers need to be notified. Your supervisor will not disclose your health information to anyone, except the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity (NEEO), and will not retain any health information. If other employees need to be notified, your name and identifying information will be protected from disclosure. For more information, please see COVID-19 Fact Sheet #8, Contact Tracing Procedure.</p>
<p>NARA is implementing these changes to ensure that employees and contractors are protected from potential exposure when they return to the NARA workplace. These procedures apply to all NARA staff and contractors who are temporarily recalled during the continued COVID-19 facility closures and will remain in effect when NARA facilities begin phased reopening.</p>
<p>Everyone has an opportunity to contribute to a safe and healthy workplace. Wearing personal protective equipment, practicing social distancing good personal hygiene, and staying home when you are sick are the most effective ways that you can protect your own health and the health of your colleagues.</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
