<h2>Attestation for Use of Supply Chain Assistance (SCA) Funding</h2>
<p>To assist school districts experiencing supply chain disruptions during SY 2021-2022, USDA has authorized funds referred to as Supply Chain Assistance (SCA) funds.  These funds are authorized under the Commodity Credit Corporation Act (15 U.S.C. 714).</p>
<p>In order for districts to receive SCA funds certain conditions must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">The school food authority (SFA) must operate the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), authorized under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq), and/or the School Breakfast Program (SBP) authorized under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1773), during SY 2021-2022.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">The SFA must have experienced a supply chain disruption and an unanticipated financial burden resulting from the supply chain disruption.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">The SFA will maintain all invoices, receipts, bids, contracts, and other documentation related to all purchases made with the SCA funds not fewer than five (5) years after the close of state fiscal year 2022.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">The SFA will comply with all recordkeeping and review requirements 7 CFR 210.9(b)(17) and 7CFR 210.18, which includes maintaining documentation proving appropriate use of SCA funds</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">The SFA will comply with all applicable procurement and financial management regulations per 2CFR200.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">The SFA will make available all documentation of purchases related to the use of the SCA funds during the Administration Review and any other state or federal audit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are the only ALLOWABLE COSTS for the SCA funds:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">The SCA funds must be used exclusively to purchase unprocessed or minimally processed domestic food products.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">Foods purchased with SCA funds must be used in the NSLP, including Seamless Summer Option (SSO) and Afterschool Snack Programs, or SBP. (The SCA funds cannot be used to provide "fruit snack" to any students other than as a part of the Afterschool Snack Program.)</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">The SCA funds may be used to cover essential incidental costs related to the procurement of the unprocessed or minimally processed domestic food products, such as shipping, handling, packaging, that are part of the normal and customary price charged by a vendor for any given food product.</li>
</ul>
<p>UNALLOWABLE COST for the SCA funds, include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">Any processed food, including but not limited to the following:  pre-made pizza; baked goods, such as breads, muffins, crackers; pre-packaged sandwiches or meals; any prepared and/or pre-cooked items such as chicken nuggets or burritos, that come ready to eat or that require no further preparation beyond heating.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">Labor</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">Equipment</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">Indirect Costs or other Administrative Expenses</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">Any food of FOREIGN origin (Buy American does not apply.  DOMESTIC is MANDATORY.)</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">Any past expenditure (It is allowable to use SCA funds on new obligations or on bills for prior unpaid obligations that come due following the SFA's receipt of the SCA funds.)</li>
</ul>
<p>By signing below, I attest that:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">The SFA listed below and all schools under it's jurisdiction operating the NSLP and/or SBP will utilize the SCA as indicated above.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">I understand that the USDA Q&amp;A issued with Policy Memo SP-03-2022 and the Follow-Up QAs (as a result of the January 5th and 12th, 2022 State Agency Webinars) contain additional information, details and examples of allowable and unallowable expenses.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">I understand that if unallowable purchases are made or if adequate documentation of purchases made using SCA funds are not available at the time of review, the district will be required to return those funds to USDA from a non-federal fund source.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">I understand that SCA funds will be distributed based on the published funding formula and that additional SCA funds may be available after original disbursements are made.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">I want to request an amount lower than the available allocation in the amount of $____________ (N/A if willing to accept entire district allocation, whole dollars only if opting for lower than allocated amount.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The form must be returned to Child Nutrition Unit at ADE.CNU-A-PS@ade.arkansas.gov by March 31, 2022</p>
