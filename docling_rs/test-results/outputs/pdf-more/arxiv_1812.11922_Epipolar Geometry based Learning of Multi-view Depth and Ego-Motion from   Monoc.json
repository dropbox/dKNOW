In order to ensure that such pixels are given a low weight, we weight them with their epipolar distance, which would be low if a pixel is properly projected. If the epipolar loss is high, it means that the projection is wrong, giving a high weight to the photometric loss, thereby increasing its overall penalty.

All our variants perform significantly better than the standard SfMLearner without the explainability mask showing that our method has a positive effect on the learning. Just adding 2-view depth prediction without epipolar constraints (Ours no-epi) gives a significant improvement showing that using multiple views provide better depth estimates, compared to a single view.
