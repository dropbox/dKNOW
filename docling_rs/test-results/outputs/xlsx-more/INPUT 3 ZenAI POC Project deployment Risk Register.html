<table><tbody><tr><th>Number</th><th>Title</th><th>Details</th><th>Likelihood</th><th>Impact</th><th>Mitigation</th><th>Likelihood (after mitigation)</th><th>Impact (after mitigation)</th></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Difficulty of configuration of local information systems (i.e. Bob&#x27;s Bikes inventory Management system is not fit for the application of ZenAI)</td><td>This project seeks to apply Zen Cycle’s, ‘ZenAI’ capability to improve the efficiency of Bob&#x27;s Bikes internal inventory management system.  There is a risk that the inventory management systems at Bob&#x27;s Bikes are of a challenging quality and insufficently digitised to see the successful application of ZenAI over the course of the project.</td><td>Medium</td><td>High</td><td>The agreed project plan is scoped to contain multiple feedback points with a detailed consideration of Bob&#x27;s Bikes Inventory Management system.  In addition, pre-work has already been undertaken to get an understanding of the systems Bob&#x27;s bikes used for information management and confidence has been attained to understand that the information is of sufficient quality and viable formats to apply ZenAI.  Should unforeseen data tidying or data wrangling activity occur, a further mitigation step will be taken to adjust platform complexity as required to ensure the focus of the work remains upon delivery of a functioning end to end ZenAI POC.</td><td>Low</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>Reduced staff availability</td><td>Impact of reduced staff availability or force majeure disruptions (e.g pandemics such as COVID) on project planning and delivery. There is a potential risk that staff illness or restrictions similar to COVID lock-downs could impact on the availability of the project team to deliver this work.</td><td>Medium</td><td>Medium</td><td>Zen Cycles are based in Oxford, UK.  Bob&#x27;s BIkes are based in Oxford, UK.  A good working relationship and access to the team at Bob&#x27;s Bikes has been established by the Zen Cycles team.  In the event that physical meetings are disrupted, we are able to host workshops and review deliverables and meetings virtually (through virtual events and electronic deliverables). In addition, the project team is derived from established teams within Zen Cycles. The Engineers, Leadership team and Project Managers have a significant background of collaboration and support working for a range of product demonstrations and project deliveries. In the event of any staff ill health or lack of availability, we have a broad resilience scoped into the existing delivery team.</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>Lack of stakeholder engagement/data</td><td>Lack of stakeholder engagement. There is a potential risk that the user&#x27;s in Bob&#x27;s Bikes do not engage with the ZenAI trials or change their desire to support this project as it progresses. This could result in a lack of feedback on the ZenAI POC, which could make progress assessments challenging and reduce the chance of commercial exploitation</td><td>Medium</td><td>High</td><td>The project plan has been scoped to allow Zen Cycles to bring in other potential users from its own industry network and experience to provide access to a wider group of stakeholders  as required.  However, the level of access and understanding already establised with the team at Bob&#x27;s Bikes (especially with the initial requiremetns gathering) mean there is already a good level of understanding and access to data sets that mean ZenAI could already have meaningful deployment.</td><td>Low</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Insufficient ZenAI maturity to handle the difficulty of the task of managing and improving the local information requirements of Bob&#x27;s Bikes inventory management system.</td><td>There is a risk that that user expectation might exceed the capability that ZenAI can provide in this experiment and that users at Bob&#x27;s Bikes are left disappointed and feel let down by the lack of gains to their own local efficiency from the promised trial.</td><td>Medium</td><td>Medium</td><td>As illustrated in the project plan, user feedback will be fed in throughout the project to make it clear that users are a) engaged with and their feelings are listened to and b) their expectations about what ZenAI will deliver will be clear.  Throughout the project delviery the users of ZenAI will be made aware that this is an initial proof of concept and not a commercially mature solution.</td><td>Low</td><td>Low</td></tr></tbody></table>
