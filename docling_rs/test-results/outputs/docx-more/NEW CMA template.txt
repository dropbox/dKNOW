## 8. Pricing Recommendations

There are certain factors that are within our control and some factors beyond our control when it comes to setting the price. Those factors within our control are: the appearance of the property, how aggressively we market the property and the price. Factors outside our control are: location of property, size and local amenities. It's important to accept those factors that are beyond our control and focus on the pricing and preparation.

A property priced at market value will attract more buyers than a home priced above market value. Consider that a competitively priced property will also attract a greater number of potential buyers and increase your opportunity for a quick sale.
