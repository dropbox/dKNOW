## Case: Undercover Investigation Assignment

Case Number: MERC-1403PI-2025

Investigator: Romeo Steinfeld

Assignment Start Date: June 28, 2025

Assignment Duration: Approximately 3 Months

Client: Saide’s Style and Fashion

### Objective

Your objectives are to investigate the current working staff, particularly the two individuals of interest (Rebeka and Viktoria), as specified by the client. The client reports a sudden loss of revenue and discrepancies at this specific location that require further investigation.

FIRST WEEK:

Today I started the investigation. I reviewed the objectives and responsibilities and focused on following these instructions accurately. It’s important to watch their behavior, the way they deal with money, their transactions, and their behaviors.

My goal for this week is to make sure I fit in as a regular employee and they don’t suspect anything. From what the client states, there are issues with financial discrepancy which may be due to employee theft. This week I focused on paying more attention to the store manager and her assistant since it was directed by the client.

### Responsibilities

Blend into the environment 
Take detailed notes of daily interactions, suspicious behaviors, and employee routines.
Observe all interactions related to cash and inventory.
Monitor store manager Rebeka's routine and her interactions with staff.

Monitor store assistant manager Viktoria’s routine and behavior when around Rebeka.

Monitor end of day closing and practices when logging in money to be taken to the bank.
Submit weekly reports with specific timelines for each incident.

BEHAVIOR OF STAFF AND MY OBSERVATIONS

This first week I interacted with the manager and assistant manager, Jocie and Phil, who were in charge of training me. My interactions with the manager and assistant manager were unfortunately not long enough because I had to be training with Phil. This made it really difficult for me to follow them and then to write my notes when possible.

Below I list my key notes from my observations this week.

Key notes:

Manager did not take cash from the registers every day I was there.

The managers spend time together with Jocie and even close the door sometimes.

Money was taken to the bank once, even though it was collected multiple times.

Money was taken at 1200 2 times and 1 time at 122pm.

An unknown man appears to know Rebeka, Viktoria, and Jocie.

The unknown man was talking mainly with Jocie.

The unknown man, from what Phil said, started to come around 5 weeks ago.

Phil is neutral but expressed his dislike of Viktoria.

Managing staff leaves for the day at inconsistent times.

Managers do not engage with staff often.

### 

MY NOTES:

Please check the timelines in this template. This template is helpful with analyzing the staff behavior and patterns. Considering this is the beginning of the investigation, I can see that the managers feel comfortable with me and even have invited me to go out with them out of work. Week 2 begins July 5.
