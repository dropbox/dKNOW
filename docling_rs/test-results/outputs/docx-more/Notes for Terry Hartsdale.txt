**Student interview notes 9/27/23:**

male, 9 years old, gen ed class. Brown hair, blue eyes, appropriately dressed. School uniform, Velcro sneakers, glasses, orange bracelet. TERRY excitedly discussed coding, YouTube, and creating videos. This writer + student played with fidgets while speaking.

TERRY likes science and learning about anatomy, but not division. Friends with Simon. Recently switched to new class and likes his new teacher.

TERRY is close to his sister and they go to build-a-bear. He likes playing Xbox when his dad lets him.

TERRY displayed intermittent eye contact and was engaged in the topics.

Halfway through the interview, he began walking around the room. Was redirected to the sofa and played with fidgets. Identified CA on a fidget globe.

After the interview TERRY put everything away and went back to class appropriately.

**Developmental info:**

First word: 3.5 years old

Dress self: requires help

Late on developmental milestones, as above. Most between 4-5 years old.

Speech therapy, behavioral therapy, and occupational therapy at 3-4 years old, as well as ABA. Then insurance dropped the services. Mom tried to copy these services at home and says TERRY started reaching his milestones “all at once” between 4-5 years old

APRN doesn’t recommend more therapies as of spring 2023 but referred for social skills and reading comprehension help – mom is awaiting insurance info on coverage

Mom says he always acted less mature than his age and doesn’t have appropriate social skills. Plays with baby toys, doesn’t tie shoes or dress himself or clean up after bathroom. On-level academically.

TERRY hates loud noises, especially in public bathrooms. He can hear humming from lights and some computers.

**Student observation in classroom 9/14/23, 9:20-9:50 AM:**

Appropriately dressed in uniform

Desk isolated, facing wall. Body turned towards front where lesson was.

Teacher mentioned “pamphlet” TERRY turned to desk and repeated word 3 x to himself

Teacher walked over w/ visual cue to redirect TERRY; it worked

TERRY answered a question appropriately and retold a story. Turned back to desk a few times as classmates answered and was redirected

He answered another question appropriately but wrong. Looked through items for answer then got distracted by the Velcro on his shoes

Class was instructed to write on “hamburger” sheet. TERRY looked for it, didn’t find it, and started writing on another sheet. He was doodling. Teacher repeated instructions to TERRY. He tapped pencils together.

He asked to go to the bathroom, was granted permission, went, and returned. Teacher went over to him to discuss his work and TERRY protested. He then turned back to paper and looked at his desk in silence.

**Student observation 2 in lunchroom 9/14/23:**

Entered, joined lunch line. Normally, he sits alone. Today he was allowed to rejoin class.

During lunch, spoke openly w/ peers. Ate pizza. Appropriate topics. At one point, he yelled “You want the food?” to a girl at opposite end. Unaddressed, he returned to peers closer to him.

TERRY raised his hand and told an adult his peer “sees colors different” was explained that this happens sometimes; he expressed understanding.

End of lunch, packed up lunchbox, threw trash away, teacher entered, he got in assigned line spot and left.

**Teacher interview 9/14/23:**

TERRY struggles with writing and focus. Yells in class. Not socially appropriate skills. Has one friend, Billy. Billy is calm.

Sits alone at lunch because he used to speak very loudly to peers which bothered them.

TERRY prefers individual work in class. Interrupts often during reading and writing; better in science and math. Needs constant redirection in the former. Doesn’t regulate his volume. May kick desk if aggravated.

Has used rewards system with behavior tracker. Small improvement so far.

TERRY has two teachers. In reading/writing he sits alone. In math/science he sits with peers and enjoys more of the tasks. Tends to speak out of turn and call out.

**Parent interview:**

Mom says TERRY is smart, advanced reader, good with numbers. Computer savvy, creates webpages, PP, fliers, videos. Loves coding, LEGOS, anything he can take apart and put back together. Interested in tech. doesn’t like being outside a lot

Challenges include following directions, sitting still, volume, staying on task, has issues when told no. May throw fit, yell, scream, stomp, or ignore the person. Fixates. Sometimes redirected with rewards. May have trouble stopping once reward time is up.

Mom says he can’t choose between multiple options. Must be presented one thing at a time. He says reading and writing is too easy and boring.

Negative behavior triggers: certain noises, loud sounds, static, vacuum sounds, blenders. Panics and yells or throws things. Doesn’t go out in public much because of this and bathroom sound issues.

May tap or bang objects or cover one of his ears. Neurologist says this may help him cope with stress or anxiety.

April 2023 provided with headset for auditory overstimulation. Sometimes they help sometimes they distract him.

At home, he needs to pick up after himself, put clothes in laundry basket, put dishes in sink. He is messy. He cleans up when asked usually.

Consequences at home are time-out or bed early. He throws a tantrum with these and uses excuses to get out (ex. “I have to use the bathroom). Sometimes mom gives in. TERRY apologies sometimes. One repercussion is to read a book, which he will comply

Parents met as teens, married over 20 years. They grew up in Houston, met in Dallas, and now live in CA. Live in single-family home. No history of mental illness on both sides. Brother ROBERT and TERRY butt heads and have similar personalities and close birthdays. Rob has ADHD and had an IEP too

TERRY gets along with sister despite large age gap. Siblings describe a largely affectionate relationship, “buddies”; no inappropriate behaviors noted. Go to mall together and park, like a second mom

TERRY manipulates dad to get what he wants. Acts “extra sweet” with dad. TERRY responds to discipline from both parents the same. Sometimes apologizes to mom with note saying “Do you forgive me?”

Family plays board games, but TERRY throws a fit if he loses. Try to watch movies together but TERRY gets distracted. Family attends church. TERRY eats meals with family but walks during them.

Mom says he doesn’t know what a real friend is. He interacts with younger kids better than his age. Sees his cousin’s kids weekly for short times. Likes talking to adults. Gullible, doesn’t understand sarcasm

No family involvement with any agencies in community.

Mom thinks he would benefit from headphones and breaks in class. Environmental flexibility (e.g. seating) is helpful. TERRY likes to help and getting an assigned role/job in class if it’s specific to him.
