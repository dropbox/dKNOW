<em><p>ESSEX COUNTY INVESTIGATIONS</p></em>
<u><p>Case: Surveillance Investigation</p></u>
<p>Case Number: MERC-1410PI-2025</p>
<p>Assigned to: Field Investigator</p>
<p>Assignment Start Date: July 3, 2025</p>
<p>Subject/s: Wife</p>
<p>Vehicle: 2010 four-door sedan, white (Registration number 12345)</p>
<p>Location: 725 Empire Road</p>
<p>Client: Husband</p>
<p></p>
<p>Below is a list of timelines I observed while conducting this surveillance investigation on the date.</p>
<p></p>
<u><p>Surveillance:</p></u>
<p></p>
<p>7:25pm: Arrived at the location; a car was parked in the front.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7:45pm: Wife left the house, got into her car, and drove away.</p>
<p></p>
<p>9:00pm: She arrived at 521 Reading Street, where there was a sign saying, “We have book clubs.” She walked inside. From the glass window, I could see her hugging other women.</p>
<p></p>
<p>10:00pm: She left the book club and got into her car. I followed her.</p>
<p></p>
<p>1030pm: Arrived at 673 Cheater Lane, a single family home made of part brick and part vinyl. She parked the vehicle, and a man greeted her with a hug.</p>
<p></p>
<p>10:32pm: They walked inside his house, holding hands.</p>
<p></p>
<p>11:57pm: The female walked outside alone, buttoning up her shirt, and her hair was messy. She got into her car and drove away. I followed her.</p>
<p></p>
<p>1:20am: Arrived at her home at 725 Empire Road. I ended my investigation since she had returned home.</p>
<p></p>
<u><p>Notes:</p></u>
<p>Although the surveillance was brief, it revealed a significant amount of activity. I managed to capture images of the wife embracing another man and spending time at his house. When she left his home, her hair was disheveled, and she was buttoning her shirt, as if she had just put it on. She returned home late at night. Once she was inside her home, I concluded the investigation.</p>
