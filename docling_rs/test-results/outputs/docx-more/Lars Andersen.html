<strong><p>Lars Andersen, Fair Farm Technologies</p></strong>
<p>We started the project back in 2007, so it’s quite an old story. The request came from a farmer whether it was possible to find a solution to tell him where his cow was within one metre of accuracy.</p>
<p>Back then there was no wireless technology available</p>
<p>Until then, most science had relied on people sitting for hours, just watching cows to identify changes in their behaviour. Real-time tracking made it possible to collect accurate data continuously.</p>
<p>We went ot the Danish cattle federation to talk to them to see if they would be interested.</p>
<p>Everyone went ballistic, actually when we introduced our</p>
<p>When we introduced the idea to the Danish Cattle Federation, the reaction was immediate. People could see it would change the way livestock was managed.</p>
<p>There was a professor from the campus university of animal behaviour., he announced in a few years this would totally change the way we were managing livestock.</p>
<p>My background is not at all from agriculture. At the time I did not know anything about the how and why of how a farmer is managing livestock.</p>
<p>What we planned then we talked with the veterinarians, they said they would love to have such a system available because up till now any science work has been done by manual observations. They have been sitting and looking at cow’s behaviour day in and day out and trying to identify the changes they are doing throughout the day.</p>
<p>By having an RTLS system, they have a rather high accuracy. One of the challenges we had in the beginning was finding a technology that was able to give us the triangulation or accuracy that was good enough.</p>
<p>Until then we have been within several metres. And that is not enough to identify her change in behaviour.</p>
<p>The tags track her movements 2-3 times a second. Right now we’re running 1 The hertz, 1 times a second,  each tag is sending an uplink, that’s just identifying itself to the network. It’s saying I’m here. It does that continuously one time per second a day.</p>
<p>In the roof or ceiling there are sensors sitting and listening to all the tags sending information. If three or more sensors can identify a tag by its identity as a tag id then the sensors will listen to that and respond back to the sensor unit that I have heard this tag and I heard it at this millisecond. If you have enough then the central processor will be able to say ok, the time difference of this readings coming back to the sensor is actually coming back to giving me the possibility to calculate the distance from each of the sensors. So where is that tag placed right now, x or y.</p>
<p>RTLS is about identifying our position. Like GPS in our car. It’s exactly the same thing. The gps in our car can only track as</p>
<p>All the gps suppliers are using maps with accurate positions of where the roads are. And as long as our gps signals are somewhere near the road then we must be on the road, we can’t be off the road, because then we</p>
<p>It’s more or less the same type of technology. The more satellites that can see your car the more accurate the gps system is.</p>
<p>By having an accurate rtls system, by using ultra high wide band, the radial waves is coming so fast that the distance between the waves.</p>
<p>How far</p>
<p>It depends on the infrastructure. Right now the system we have created is able to identify up to 300, 400 feet around the barn. When the cows are at pasture we will not be able to track them. We will use combined sensors, accelerometers and so on.</p>
<p>Compared to any other tracking methods we are looking at the individual cows own behaviour. We are able to identify whenever there is change in her behaviour.</p>
<p>Until now they’ve used accelerometers with pedometers, mechanical sensors that are not able to track individual cows behaviour, they use an algorithm tracking whether she has a high activity compared to what the overall stand up is.</p>
<p>What we are trying to do is say that ok, now we are putting this tag on this cow and for the next 6-10 days we are logging all the individual information on this cow to be able to identify her normal routine.</p>
<p>If she can, she will choose to lie down for the same amount of time, eat the same amount and walk the same distance.</p>
<p>The changes that now come according to her health status is that when she’s going into heat it’s money in the bank for the farmer, as soon as he can get her inseminated after calving, the sooner he will keep her fertility up.</p>
<p>We are saying she has a high activity, farmer please go and check her.</p>
<p>She eats the same amount of food, but will be too active,</p>
<p>A cow is a herd animal, so she will try and hide her weaknesses as much as possible, but she can't hide her changes in behaviour.</p>
<p>But a farmer might not see change in behaviour because there is no physical sickness.</p>
<p>If a cow comes into heat, she becomes more active and starts socialising. She may walk more, spend less time eating or resting. On the other side, if her activity drops, that can indicate lameness or illness</p>
<p>She will be out of her cubicle. She will be too stressed or active, she needs the same amount of food but she will be too active to stay there and eat, she will walk into the feeding table and then walk out to play with her female colleagues. So there is a typical signal</p>
<p>If you identify it before it becomes visible, you have saved the cow. Once there is a fever or a clear sickness, it is often too late.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So reduced time in bed, more active zone shifts, more distance walked or more time standing. That is typical signals.</p>
<p>The other way around if it’s low activity, if it’s lameness it’s a huge cost to farmers, the other side of the business if he identifies a cow coming into an illness will have saved the cow because the moemen she has a physical sickness or a fever it’s already too late.</p>
<p>Prevention is always better than cure. If you can intervene earlier, the cow suffers less, the farmer spends less, and the milk is better quality.</p>
<p>Then</p>
<p>All cows are required to be tagged in denmark</p>
<p>Smartbow</p>
<p>One big problem is that they’re using 2.4ghz</p>
<p>We have a tag on a cow that has a lifetime of at least 7 years – a lifetime tag. They will put a tag on a cow as early as possible. Right now it’s when the heifers give birth first time. Then she will be tagged. We expect very soon to be able to come up with an ear tag as well. That from my perspective is doable.</p>
<p>The reason why we chose ultra wide band is that we have very low power consumption, but that’s something that we were very very keen on, two way communicating with the tag. It is almost impossible with today’s technology to receive more than two years</p>
<p>Power consumption the other is accuracy – 2.5 metre</p>
<p>30 – 50 centimetre. We can identify which cubicles she’s actually lying in</p>
<p>If we used an accelerometer combined with the sensor we could be even more accurate. We could come down to ten centimetres.</p>
<p>What we are testing now is whether we can using it for calfing, by asking the system to give us more uplinks. We are testing for saying whether we can say now she is nesting, then the farmer doesn’t need to watch her hour by hour, he can wait till he gets an alert.</p>
<p>They can live to 16 with no problems. But the European average is 5, and that’s down to the heifers that have never been in heat, and first calfer, a heifer coming into a big herd, she needs attention to get a good start on lactation. It is the most important period in their life. The cows have a very high hierarchy between themselves. So you have to see, can she stand the environment. She has to find her place in the hierarchy. And the chance is that if she’s not getting a good start she will be identified as a loser cow quite quickly.</p>
<p>We have four running in Denmark two in Germany and one in the Netherlands – about to install in the UK, there are already orders coming in, and installing one in the US in early June,</p>
<p>Four more across Europe this year plus one new order in Denmark</p>
<p>The of the important things is the mental freedom, knowing that there is something tracking my cow so I don’t need to go and identify them continually, not only for the farmer but his imployees. That is priceless. The mental freedom to not have to think, have I forgotten something.</p>
<p>Another thing we can identify now is whether there is enough feed on the table for them. If the feed is not pushed into the cows</p>
<p>Every time a cow is lost to disease, that is wasted feed, wasted water, wasted energy, if technology can prevent that, it helps the environment as well as the farmer.</p>
