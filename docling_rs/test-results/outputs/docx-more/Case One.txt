**Customer:** What do you mean by name??

**Support:** The name of the merchant.

**Customer:** Oh I thought u meant my name. Merchant is Shell. It’s a gas station

**Support:** Got it. Let me look.

**Support:** Found it! Is it a $125 payment?

**Customer:** Yea but I only spent $30 something why is it $125 pending??

**Support:** Gas stations typically don’t know how much you’ll pump, so it’s common for gas stations to place an authorization hold for a larger amount. This ensures that you have enough money to cover the cost of the purchase, no matter how much gas you pump. This hold should fall off once the transaction is completed, which tends to take 1-3 days.

**Customer:** So I have to wait 3 days??

**Support:** This hold should fall off once the transaction is completed, which tends to take 1-3 days.

**Customer:** Can’t you take it off faster??
