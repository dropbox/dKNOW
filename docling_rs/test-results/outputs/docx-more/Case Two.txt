**Case Two**

**Customer:** Helllpppp I was robbed stupid theives

**Support:** I want to help you out today, but you need to keep the conversation respectful.

**Customer:** What are you talking about?

**Support:** We have a zero tolerance policy for abusive language

**Customer:** WHAT!? What abusive language!???

**Support:** Can I help you with anything else today?

**Customer:** YES!!!! I WAS ROBBED!

**Support:** Does this involve a specific transaction?

**Customer:** Yes!! It was a purchase made at Fred Meyer today for $300!!

**Support:** Thanks for that. I’m going to pull up the transaction.

**Support:** I see that a transaction was completed earlier today for $321.52 at a Fred Meyer at 10:08 AM PST. Is this the transaction?

**Customer:** YES

**Support:** Thanks. Why do you believe you were robbed?

**Customer:** I didn’t make that purchase!!

**Support:** Do you know who did?

**Customer:** NO! My card was stolen!!

**Support:** Got it. The transaction is still in a pending state, but we’ll be able to open a dispute claim once it’s completed. You can also initiate a dispute yourself through your mobile app by selecting the transaction from your Transactions screen, tapping the “...” icon in the top-right corner, and selecting “Dispute”. You will still need to wait for the transaction to be completed, though. Would you like me to report your card stolen to protect you from other unauthorized charges?

**Customer:** Yea

**Support:** One moment

**Support:** Ok, I’ve reported that card stolen, so it has been deactivated. You should be receiving a replacement card in the mail within 7-10 business days. Is there anything else you need from me today?

**Customer:** No

**Support:** Have a wonderful day!
