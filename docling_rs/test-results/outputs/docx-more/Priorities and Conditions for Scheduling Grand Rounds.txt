**Priorities and Conditions for Scheduling Grand Rounds**

- The grand rounds calendar follows the academic calendar (July 1 - June 30).
- Grand rounds occur every Wednesday from 7-9AM.
- “All Periop Meeting” is required and cannot be rescheduled (See All Periop Schedule in the Meeting Schedules Doc).
- Required School of Medicine talks must take place within their specific date range and cannot be rescheduled outside of it (See Required by School of Medicine in the Meeting Schedules Doc).
- Faculty Breakfast cannot be rescheduled and must be the second Wednesday of each month.
- M&amp;M must be the first Wednesday of each month. It can be rescheduled to a later date or time only if it can still be scheduled during the same month and only if no other topics can be rescheduled. The only exception is the combined M&amp;M which will replace one of the M&amp;M's and the Annual Research Symposium.
- MS4 Presentations are required and must be scheduled on the Wednesday of the last or second to last week of the rotation with higher priority given to the last week of the rotation (see MS4 Rotation Schedule in the n the Meeting Schedules Doc). They also cannot take place during Faculty Breakfast.
- Labs should be scheduled in the order they are listed in the “Topics &amp; Labs” sheet. Labs should be scheduled during faculty breakfast when possible. The micro lab must take place between July 1 and October 31 and is required to take place before any other labs are scheduled as tit is a prerequisite to the cadaver labs. Starting in November, Cadaver labs 1-2 should take place within 1 month of each other, Cadaver lab 3 should take place by March, and Cadaver Labs 4, 5, and 6 should be spaced out as evenly as possible from one another with lab 6 being no later than the second Wednesday of May.
- An alternative date for each lab must be created following the same priorities and conditions for scheduling the lab. Schedule the alternate labs in the notes section next to the alternate date and indicate which lab would take place here. Place “Alternate” after the lab name to avoid confusion.
- Labs take priority over additional talks and can replace them as needed, but alternate lab dates cannot be placed on dates when required topics are taking place.
- Chief and Fellow talks are required and cannot be rescheduled once set.
- Resident QI takes priority over additional talks.
- Airway Cart Review should be scheduled during Faculty Breakfast if possible.
- Visiting Professor cannot take place during Faculty Breakfast.
- Fill in any remaining 2-hour spaces with optional labs (optional labs cannot be within 1 weeks of optional or required labs) and 1-hour spaces with additional talks.
- If the topic lasts less than 1 hour, write in the notes section how long the topic is scheduled for.
- For MS4 Presentations, indicate the number of students presenting. If less than 4, indicate the amount of time that the MS4 Presentations will take.
